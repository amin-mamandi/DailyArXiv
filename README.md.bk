| **[SpatialVLA: Exploring Spatial Representations for Visual-Language-Action Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15830v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we claim that spatial understanding is the keypoint in robot manipulation, and propose SpatialVLA to explore effective spatial representations for the robot foundation model. Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning. All the details and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Realistic synthetic populations with numerous attributes strengthen these simulations. The Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network, trained on census data like EU-SILC, can create robust synthetic populations. These methods, aided by external statistics or EU-SILC weights, generate spatial synthetic populations for agent-based models. The increased access to high-quality micro-data has sparked interest in synthetic populations, which preserve demographic profiles and analytical strength while ensuring privacy and preventing discrimination. This study uses national data from Finland and Greece for Helsinki and Thessaloniki to explore balanced spatial synthetic population generation. Results show challenges related to balancing data with or without aggregated statistics for the target population and the general under-representation of fringe profiles by deep generative methods. The latter can lead to discrimination in agent-based simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at European Social Simulation Conference in Krakow 2024</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of [A. Longa, G. Cencetti, B. Lepri, and A. Passerini, An efficient procedure for mining egocentric temporal motifs, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 36, 355 (2022)]. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[On spatial point processes with composition-valued marks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16049v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods for marked spatial point processes with scalar marks have seen extensive development in recent years. While the impressive progress in data collection and storage capacities has yielded an immense increase in spatial point process data with highly challenging non-scalar marks, methods for their analysis are not equally well developed. In particular, there are no methods for composition-valued marks, i.e. vector-valued marks with a sum-to-constant constrain (typically 1 or 100). Prompted by the need for a suitable methodological framework, we extend existing methods to spatial point processes with composition-valued marks and adapt common mark characteristics to this context. The proposed methods are applied to analyse spatial correlations in data on tree crown-to-base and business sector compositions.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Generative Modeling for Spatially Resolved Gene Expression Inference from Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15598v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) allows a high-resolution measurement of RNA sequence abundance by systematically connecting cell morphology depicted in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained histology images to spatially resolved gene expressions. ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&E stained histology images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Spatial Predictive Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05197v4)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to spatial dependence -- often characterized as complex and non-linear -- model misspecification is a prevalent and critical issue in spatial data analysis and prediction. As the data, and thus model performance, is heterogeneous, typical model selection and ensemble methods that assume homogeneity are not suitable. We address the issue of model uncertainty for spatial data by proposing a novel Bayesian ensemble methodology that captures spatially-varying model uncertainty and performance heterogeneity of multiple spatial predictions, and synthesizes them for improved predictions, which we call Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis. Our proposal is defined by specifying a latent factor spatially-varying coefficient model as the synthesis function, which enables spatial characteristics of each model to be learned and ensemble coefficients to vary over regions to achieve flexible predictions. We derive our method from the theoretically best approximation of the data generating process, and show that it provides a finite sample theoretical guarantee for its predictive performance, specifically that the predictions are exact minimax. Two MCMC strategies are implemented for full uncertainty quantification, as well as a variational inference strategy for fast point inference. We also extend the estimation strategy for general responses. Through simulation examples and two real data applications in real estate and ecology, our proposed Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis outperforms standard spatial models and ensemble methods, and advanced machine learning methods, in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while maintaining interpretability of the prediction mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages (main) + 15 pages (supplementary material)</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Spatial Cues from Cochlear Implant Microphones to Efficiently Enhance Speech Separation in Real-World Listening Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14610v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech separation approaches for single-channel, dry speech mixtures have significantly improved. However, real-world spatial and reverberant acoustic environments remain challenging, limiting the effectiveness of these approaches for assistive hearing devices like cochlear implants (CIs). To address this, we quantify the impact of real-world acoustic scenes on speech separation and explore how spatial cues can enhance separation quality efficiently. We analyze performance based on implicit spatial cues (inherent in the acoustic input and learned by the model) and explicit spatial cues (manually calculated spatial features added as auxiliary inputs). Our findings show that spatial cues (both implicit and explicit) improve separation for mixtures with spatially separated and nearby talkers. Furthermore, spatial cues enhance separation when spectral cues are ambiguous, such as when voices are similar. Explicit spatial cues are particularly beneficial when implicit spatial cues are weak. For instance, single CI microphone recordings provide weaker implicit spatial cues than bilateral CIs, but even single CIs benefit from explicit cues. These results emphasize the importance of training models on real-world data to improve generalizability in everyday listening scenarios. Additionally, our statistical analyses offer insights into how data properties influence model performance, supporting the development of efficient speech separation approaches for CIs and other assistive devices in real-world settings.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[High-Precision Fabric Defect Detection via Adaptive Shape Convolutions and Large Kernel Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14190v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting fabric defects in the textile industry remains a challenging task due to the diverse and complex nature of defect patterns. Traditional methods often suffer from slow inference speeds, limited accuracy, and inadequate recognition rates, particularly in scenarios involving intricate or subtle defects. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Fab-ASLKS, an advanced fabric defect detection framework built upon the YOLOv8s architecture. Fab-ASLKS incorporates two key modules: (1) the Adaptive Shape Convolution Module (ASCM), which leverages adaptive shape convolution within the Neck to enhance feature fusion and improve efficiency by extending the capabilities of the standard C2f structure, and (2) the Large Kernel Shift Convolution Module (LKSCM), designed to emulate large kernel effects within the Backbone, enabling superior spatial information extraction. These modules collaboratively optimize feature extraction and information integration across the network. Extensive experiments conducted on the Tianchi fabric defect detection dataset demonstrate that Fab-ASLKS achieves a 5% improvement in mAP@50 over the baseline, showcasing its capability to deliver high precision and efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Scalable Variational Bayes Approach to Fit High-dimensional Spatial Generalized Linear Mixed Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15705v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian and discrete non-Gaussian spatial datasets are common across fields like public health, ecology, geosciences, and social sciences. Bayesian spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) are a flexible class of models for analyzing such data, but they struggle to scale to large datasets. Many scalable Bayesian methods, built upon basis representations or sparse covariance matrices, still rely on posterior sampling via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Variational Bayes (VB) methods have been applied to SGLMMs, but only for small areal datasets. We propose two computationally efficient VB approaches for analyzing moderately sized and massive (millions of locations) Gaussian and discrete non-Gaussian spatial data in the continuous spatial domain. Our methods leverage semi-parametric approximations of latent spatial processes and parallel computing to ensure computational efficiency. The proposed methods deliver inferential and predictive performance comparable to gold-standard MCMC methods while achieving computational speedups of up to 3600 times. In most cases, our VB approaches outperform state-of-the-art alternatives such as INLA and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We validate our methods through a comparative numerical study and applications to real-world datasets. These VB approaches can enable practitioners to model millions of discrete non-Gaussian spatial observations on standard laptops, significantly expanding access to advanced spatial modeling tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 Pa...</summary><p>26 Pages for the main paper, 60 pages for the supplemental information, 5 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Fourier analysis of spatial point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06403v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we develop comprehensive frequency domain methods for estimating and inferring the second-order structure of spatial point processes. The main element here is on utilizing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the point pattern and its tapered counterpart. Under second-order stationarity, we show that both the DFTs and the tapered DFTs are asymptotically jointly independent Gaussian even when the DFTs share the same limiting frequencies. Based on these results, we establish an $\alpha$-mixing central limit theorem for a statistic formulated as a quadratic form of the tapered DFT. As applications, we derive the asymptotic distribution of the kernel spectral density estimator and establish a frequency domain inferential method for parametric stationary point processes. For the latter, the resulting model parameter estimator is computationally tractable and yields meaningful interpretations even in the case of model misspecification. We investigate the finite sample performance of our estimator through simulations, considering scenarios of both correctly specified and misspecified models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-USleepNet: A Spatial-Temporal Coupling Prominence Network for Multi-Channel Sleep Staging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11884v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep staging is critical to assess sleep quality and diagnose disorders. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at: https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) to refine sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously to build the navigation map is a fundamental task in logistics and robotics. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods. Moreover, the resulting point cloud maps are used for automatic last-mile delivery in large-scale complex scenes.

| **[SpatialCoT: Advancing Spatial Reasoning through Coordinate Alignment and Chain-of-Thought for Embodied Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10074v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is an essential problem in embodied AI research. Efforts to enhance spatial reasoning abilities through supplementary spatial data and fine-tuning have proven limited and ineffective when addressing complex embodied tasks, largely due to their dependence on language-based outputs. While some approaches have introduced a point-based action space to mitigate this issue, they fall short in managing more intricate tasks within complex environments. This deficiency arises from their failure to fully exploit the inherent thinking and reasoning capabilities that are fundamental strengths of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach named SpatialCoT, specifically designed to bolster the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our approach comprises two stages: spatial coordinate bi-directional alignment, which aligns vision-language inputs with spatial coordinates, and chain-of-thought spatial grounding, which harnesses the reasoning capabilities of language models for advanced spatial reasoning. We evaluate SpatialCoT on challenging navigation and manipulation tasks, both in simulation and real-world settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[A Dimension-Reduced Multivariate Spatial Model for Extreme Events: Balancing Flexibility and Scalability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13070v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling extreme precipitation and temperature is vital for understanding the impacts of climate change, as hazards like intense rainfall and record-breaking temperatures can result in severe consequences, including floods, droughts, and wildfires. Gaining insight into the spatial variation and interactions between these extremes is critical for effective risk management, early warning systems, and informed policy-making. However, challenges such as the rarity of extreme events, spatial dependencies, and complex cross-variable interactions hinder accurate modeling. We introduce a novel framework for modeling spatial extremes, building upon spatial generalized extreme value (GEV) models. Our approach incorporates a dimension-reduced latent spatial process to improve scalability and flexibility, particularly in capturing asymmetry in cross-covariance structures. This Joint Latent Spatial GEV model (JLS-GEV) overcomes key limitations of existing methods by providing a more flexible framework for inter-variable dependencies. In addition to addressing event rarity, spatial dependence and cross-variable interactions, JLS-GEV supports nonstationary spatial behaviors and independently collected data sources, while maintaining practical fitting times through dimension reduction. We validate JLS-GEV through extensive simulation studies, demonstrating its superior performance in capturing spatial extremes compared to baseline modeling approaches. Application to real-world data on extreme precipitation and temperature in the southeastern United States highlights its practical utility. While primarily motivated by environmental challenges, this framework is broadly applicable to interdisciplinary studies of spatial extremes in interdependent natural processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving fair prediction performance across nodes is crucial in the spatial-temporal domain, as it ensures the validity and reliability of forecasting outcomes. However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense ReLU Neural Networks for Temporal-spatial Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09961v7)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we focus on fully connected deep neural networks utilizing the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function for nonparametric estimation. We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultralow-dimensionality reduction for identifying critical transitions by spatial-temporal PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12582v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Cognition from Egocentric Video: Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05072v2)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As humans move around, performing their daily tasks, they are able to recall where they have positioned objects in their environment, even if these objects are currently out of their sight. In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce a simple but effective approach to address this challenging problem, called Lift, Match, and Keep (LMK). LMK lifts partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, matches them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and keeps these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera. We benchmark LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. After 120 seconds, 57% of the objects are correctly localised by LMK, compared to just 33% by a recent 3D method for egocentric videos and 17% by a general 2D tracking method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2025. 14 pages including references and appendix.

| **[Parallel Sequence Modeling via Generalized Spatial Propagation Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12381v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN), a new attention mechanism optimized for vision tasks that inherently captures 2D spatial structures. Existing attention models, including transformers, linear attention, and state-space models like Mamba, process multi-dimensional data as 1D sequences, compromising spatial coherence and efficiency. GSPN overcomes these limitations by directly operating on spatially coherent image data and forming dense pairwise connections through a line-scan approach. Central to GSPN is the Stability-Context Condition, which ensures stable, context-aware propagation across 2D sequences and reduces the effective sequence length to $\sqrt{N}$ for a square map with N elements, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. With learnable, input-dependent weights and no reliance on positional embeddings, GSPN achieves superior spatial fidelity and state-of-the-art performance in vision tasks, including ImageNet classification, class-guided image generation, and text-to-image generation. Notably, GSPN accelerates SD-XL with softmax-attention by over $84\times$ when generating 16K images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://whj363636.github.io/GSPN/</p></details> |

We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. Finally, we extend our result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</p></details> | 46 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> |  |

To efficiently handle the irregular and sparse nature of point cloud, we propose migrating the voxels into distinct specialized ordered fields with the general spatial expansion strategies, and employ group attention mechanisms to extract the exclusive feature maps within each field. Subsequently, we integrate the feature representations across different ordered fields by alternately applying diverse expansion strategies, thereby enhancing the model's ability to capture comprehensive spatial information. The method was evaluated on the nuScenes lidar-based object detection test dataset, achieving an NDS score of 73.9 without Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) and 74.5 with TTA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, our method ranks the 1st place in the nuScenes lidar-based object detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in the Spatial-Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11854v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a multi-scale wavelet spatial attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a high-frequency feature compensation block (HFFC) is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99. 58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores how to enhance window-switching strategies for virtual displays by leveraging eye tracking provided by HWDs and underutilized spaces around the main display area. We investigate the efficiency and usability of different cursor behaviors and selection modes in a Spatial Bar interface for window-switching tasks in augmented reality environments. Results show gaze coupled with teleport led to the quickest window-switching times, particularly in tasks where the original cursor position or the target window was far from the Spatial Bar.</p></details> |  |

This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hands-free Spatial Selection and Interaction Technique using Gaze and Blink Input with Blink Prediction for Extended Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11540v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze-based interaction techniques have created significant interest in the field of spatial interaction. Many of these methods require additional input modalities, such as hand gestures (e.g., gaze coupled with pinch). Those can be uncomfortable and difficult to perform in public or limited spaces, and pose challenges for users who are unable to execute pinch gestures. To address these aspects, we propose a novel, hands-free Gaze+Blink interaction technique that leverages the user's gaze and intentional eye blinks. This technique enables users to perform selections by executing intentional blinks. It facilitates continuous interactions, such as scrolling or drag-and-drop, through eye blinks coupled with head movements. So far, this concept has not been explored for hands-free spatial interaction techniques. We evaluated the performance and user experience (UX) of our Gaze+Blink method with two user studies and compared it with Gaze+Pinch in a realistic user interface setup featuring common menu interaction tasks. Study 1 demonstrated that while Gaze+Blink achieved comparable selection speeds, it was prone to accidental selections resulting from unintentional blinks. In Study 2 we explored an enhanced technique employing a deep learning algorithms for filtering out unintentional blinks.</p></details> |  |
| **[An accuracy-runtime trade-off comparison of scalable Gaussian process approximations for spatial data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11448v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible, probabilistic, non-parametric models widely employed in various fields such as spatial statistics, time series analysis, and machine learning. A drawback of Gaussian processes is their computational cost having $\mathcal{O}(N^3)$ time and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ memory complexity which makes them prohibitive for large datasets. Numerous approximation techniques have been proposed to address this limitation. In this work, we systematically compare the accuracy of different Gaussian process approximations concerning marginal likelihood evaluation, parameter estimation, and prediction taking into account the time required to achieve a certain accuracy. We analyze this trade-off between accuracy and runtime on multiple simulated and large-scale real-world datasets and find that Vecchia approximations consistently emerge as the most accurate in almost all experiments. However, for certain real-world data sets, low-rank inducing point-based methods, i.e., full-scale and modified predictive process approximations, can provide more accurate predictive distributions for extrapolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Air Quality Mapping in Urban Areas Using Sparse Sensor Data, Satellite Imagery, Meteorological Factors, and Spatial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11270v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring air pollution is crucial for protecting human health from exposure to harmful substances. Traditional methods of air quality monitoring, such as ground-based sensors and satellite-based remote sensing, face limitations due to high deployment costs, sparse sensor coverage, and environmental interferences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a framework for high-resolution spatiotemporal Air Quality Index (AQI) mapping using sparse sensor data, satellite imagery, and various spatiotemporal factors. By leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we estimate AQI values at unmonitored locations based on both spatial and temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a wide range of environmental features, including meteorological data, road networks, points of interest (PoIs), population density, and urban green spaces, which enhance prediction accuracy. We illustrate the use of our approach through a case study in Lahore, Pakistan, where multi-resolution data is used to generate the air quality index map at a fine spatiotemporal scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Spatial Disparity in Urban Prediction Using Residual-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks: A Chicago Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11214v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban prediction tasks, such as forecasting traffic flow, temperature, and crime rates, are crucial for efficient urban planning and management. However, existing Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) often rely solely on accuracy, overlooking spatial and demographic disparities in their predictions. This oversight can lead to imbalanced resource allocation and exacerbate existing inequities in urban areas. This study introduces a Residual-Aware Attention (RAA) Block and an equality-enhancing loss function to address these disparities. By adapting the adjacency matrix during training and incorporating spatial disparity metrics, our approach aims to reduce local segregation of residuals and errors. We applied our methodology to urban prediction tasks in Chicago, utilizing a travel demand dataset as an example. Our model achieved a 48% significant improvement in fairness metrics with only a 9% increase in error metrics. Spatial analysis of residual distributions revealed that models with RAA Blocks produced more equitable prediction results, particularly by reducing errors clustered in central regions. Attention maps demonstrated the model's ability to dynamically adjust focus, leading to more balanced predictions. Case studies of various community areas in Chicago further illustrated the effectiveness of our approach in addressing spatial and demographic disparities, supporting more balanced and equitable urban planning and policy-making.</p></details> |  |

Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 10 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware model's overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework and LocBench benchmark are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial, and the Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework is available at https://github.com/seai-lab/PyGBS.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

While prior methods employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous encoding, they often struggle to capture the complexity of video data, relying on simple coordinate concatenation and pre-trained optical flow network for motion representation. Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve-and even degrade performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM performance, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Remote Sensing Image Change Detection Method Integrating Layer Exchange and Channel-Spatial Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10905v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical technique for Earth observation, primarily focusing on pixel-level segmentation of change regions between bi-temporal images. The essence of pixel-level change detection lies in determining whether corresponding pixels in bi-temporal images have changed. In deep learning, the spatial and channel dimensions of feature maps represent different information from the original images. In this study, we found that in change detection tasks, difference information can be computed not only from the spatial dimension of bi-temporal features but also from the channel dimension. Therefore, we designed the Channel-Spatial Difference Weighting (CSDW) module as an aggregation-distribution mechanism for bi-temporal features in change detection. This module enhances the sensitivity of the change detection model to difference features. Additionally, bi-temporal images share the same geographic location and exhibit strong inter-image correlations. To construct the correlation between bi-temporal images, we designed a decoding structure based on the Layer-Exchange (LE) method to enhance the interaction of bi-temporal features. Comprehensive experiments on the CLCD, PX-CLCD, LEVIR-CD, and S2Looking datasets demonstrate that the proposed LENet model significantly improves change detection performance. The code and pre-trained models will be available at: https://github.com/dyzy41/lenet.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

This ability allows humans to create mental maps, navigate through environments, and process directional cues, crucial for exploring new places and finding one's way in unfamiliar surroundings. This study takes an algorithmic approach to extract indices relevant to human spatial navigation using eye movement data. Leveraging electrooculography signals, we analyzed statistical features and applied feature engineering techniques to study eye movements during navigation tasks. The proposed work combines signal processing and machine learning approaches to develop indices for navigation and orientation, spatial anxiety, landmark recognition, path survey, and path route. The analysis yielded five subscore indices with notable accuracy. Among these, the navigation and orientation subscore achieved an R2 score of 0.72, while the landmark recognition subscore attained an R2 score of 0.50. Additionally, statistical features highly correlated with eye movement metrics, including blinks, saccades, and fixations, were identified. The findings of this study can lead to more cognitive assessments and enable early detection of spatial navigation impairments, particularly among individuals at risk of cognitive decline.</p></details> | <details><summary>The d...</summary><p>The dataset is available in the following work: Mobina Zibandehpoor, Fatemeh Alizadehziri, Arash Abbasi Larki, Sobhan Teymouri, and Mehdi Delrobaei.

| **[The Spatial Complexity of Optical Computing and How to Reduce It](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10435v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similar to algorithms, which consume time and memory to run, hardware requires resources to function. For devices processing physical waves, implementing operations needs sufficient "space," as dictated by wave physics. How much space is needed to perform a certain function is a fundamental question in optics, with recent research addressing it for given mathematical operations, but not for more general computing tasks, e.g., classification. Inspired by computational complexity theory, we study the "spatial complexity" of optical computing systems in terms of scaling laws - specifically, how their physical dimensions must scale as the dimension of the mathematical operation increases - and propose a new paradigm for designing optical computing systems: space-efficient neuromorphic optics, based on structural sparsity constraints and neural pruning methods motivated by wave physics (notably, the concept of "overlapping nonlocality"). On two mainstream platforms, free-space optics and on-chip integrated photonics, our methods demonstrate substantial size reductions (to 1%-10% the size of conventional designs) with minimal compromise on performance. Our theoretical and computational results reveal a trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as structure dimensions increase, providing a new perspective for interpreting and approaching the ultimate limits of optical computing - a balanced trade-off between device size and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRASP: A Grid-Based Benchmark for Evaluating Commonsense Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01892v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning, an important faculty of human cognition with many practical applications, is one of the core commonsense skills that is not purely language-based and, for satisfying (as opposed to optimal) solutions, requires some minimum degree of planning. Existing benchmarks of Commonsense Spatial Reasoning (CSR) tend to evaluate how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret text-based spatial $\textit{descriptions}$ rather than directly evaluate a plan produced by the LLM in response to a $\textit{specific}$ spatial reasoning problem. In this paper, we construct a large-scale benchmark called GRASP, which consists of 16,000 grid-based environments where the agent is tasked with an energy collection problem. These environments include 100 grid instances instantiated using each of the 160 different grid settings, involving five different energy distributions, two modes of agent starting position, and two distinct obstacle configurations, as well as three kinds of agent constraints. Using GRASP, we compare classic baseline approaches, such as random walk and greedy search methods, with advanced LLMs like GPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-o1-mini. The experimental results indicate that even these advanced LLMs struggle to consistently achieve satisfactory solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Clustering of Citizen Science Data Improves Downstream Species Distribution Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15559v3)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citizen science biodiversity data present great opportunities for ecology and conservation across vast spatial and temporal scales. However, the opportunistic nature of these data lacks the sampling structure required by modeling methodologies that address a pervasive challenge in ecological data collection: imperfect detection, i.e., the likelihood of under-observing species on field surveys. Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that accounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process separately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces species distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a landscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the pattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit, occupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's status (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant. Since citizen science data are not collected under the required repeated-visit protocol, observations may be grouped into sites post hoc. Existing approaches for constructing sites discard some observations and/or consider only geographic distance and not environmental similarity. In this study, we compare ten approaches for site construction in terms of their impact on downstream species distribution models for 31 bird species in Oregon, using observations recorded in the eBird database. We find that occupancy models built on sites constructed by spatial clustering algorithms perform better than existing alternatives.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[MetaNeRV: Meta Neural Representations for Videos with Spatial-Temporal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02427v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has emerged as a promising implicit neural representation (INR) approach for video analysis, which represents videos as neural networks with frame indexes as inputs. However, NeRV-based methods are time-consuming when adapting to a large number of diverse videos, as each video requires a separate NeRV model to be trained from scratch. In addition, NeRV-based methods spatially require generating a high-dimension signal (i.e., an entire image) from the input of a low-dimension timestamp, and a video typically consists of tens of frames temporally that have a minor change between adjacent frames. To improve the efficiency of video representation, we propose Meta Neural Representations for Videos, named MetaNeRV, a novel framework for fast NeRV representation for unseen videos. MetaNeRV leverages a meta-learning framework to learn an optimal parameter initialization, which serves as a good starting point for adapting to new videos. To address the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of video modality, we further introduce spatial-temporal guidance to improve the representation capabilities of MetaNeRV. Specifically, the spatial guidance with a multi-resolution loss aims to capture the information from different resolution stages, and the temporal guidance with an effective progressive learning strategy could gradually refine the number of fitted frames during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of MetaNeRV for video representations and video compression.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

Despite recent advancements in this domain, existing approaches commonly encounter a shortage: a limited amount and diversity of text3D pairs available for training. Moreover, they fall short in effectively leveraging different contextual clues (e.g., rich spatial relations within the 3D visual space) for grounding. To address these limitations, we propose AugRefer, a novel approach for advancing 3D visual grounding. AugRefer introduces cross-modal augmentation designed to extensively generate diverse text-3D pairs by placing objects into 3D scenes and creating accurate and semantically rich descriptions using foundation models. Notably, the resulting pairs can be utilized by any existing 3DVG methods for enriching their training data. Additionally, AugRefer presents a language-spatial adaptive decoder that effectively adapts the potential referring objects based on the language description and various 3D spatial relations. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets clearly validate the effectiveness of AugRefer.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

However, fully utilizing the multi-domain characteristics of EEG signals remains a significant challenge. Traditional single-perspective analyses often fail to capture the complex interplay of temporal, frequency, and spatial dimensions in EEG data. To address this, we introduce a multi-view graph transformer (MVGT) based on spatial relations that integrates information across three domains: temporal dynamics from continuous series, frequency features extracted from frequency bands, and inter-channel relationships captured through several spatial encodings. This comprehensive approach allows model to capture the nuanced properties inherent in EEG signals, enhancing its flexibility and representational power. Evaluation on publicly available datasets demonstrates that MVGT surpasses state-of-the-art methods in performance. The results highlight its ability to extract multi-domain information and effectively model inter-channel relationships, showcasing its potential for EEG-based emotion recognition tasks.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the amount of rainfall measured at different stations within a given area is shaped by atmospheric conditions, orography, and physics of water processes. Motivated by the need to analyze rainfall across complex spatial locations, we propose a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric model for spatially distributed data. This method effectively accounts for spatial correlation while incorporating dependencies on geographical characteristics in a highly flexible manner. Indeed, using latent Gaussian processes, indexed by spatial coordinates and topographical features, the model integrates spatial dependencies and environmental characteristics within a nonparametric framework. Posterior inference is conducted using an efficient rejection-free Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which eliminates the need for tuning parameter calibration, ensuring smoother and more reliable estimation. The model's flexibility is evaluated through a series of simulation studies, involving different rainfall and spatial correlation scenarios, to demonstrate its robustness across various conditions. We then apply the model to a large dataset of rainfall events collected from the Italian regions of Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige, these areas are known for their complex orography and diverse meteorological drivers. By analyzing this data, we generate detailed maps that illustrate the mean and variance of rainfall and rainy days. The method is implemented in a new R package available on GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Within this context, adaptive spatial-temporal graph neural networks (ASTGNNs) have emerged as valuable tools for modelling these dependencies, especially through a data-driven approach rather than pre-defined spatial graphs. While this approach offers higher accuracy, it presents increased computational demands. Addressing this challenge, this paper delves into the concept of localisation within ASTGNNs, introducing an innovative perspective that spatial dependencies should be dynamically evolving over time. We introduce \textit{DynAGS}, a localised ASTGNN framework aimed at maximising efficiency and accuracy in distributed deployment. This framework integrates dynamic localisation, time-evolving spatial graphs, and personalised localisation, all orchestrated around the Dynamic Graph Generator, a light-weighted central module leveraging cross attention. The central module can integrate historical information in a node-independent manner to enhance the feature representation of nodes at the current moment. This improved feature representation is then used to generate a dynamic sparse graph without the need for costly data exchanges, and it supports personalised localisation. Performance assessments across two core ASTGNN architectures and nine real-world datasets from various applications reveal that \textit{DynAGS} outshines current benchmarks, underscoring that the dynamic modelling of spatial dependencies can drastically improve model expressibility, flexibility, and system efficiency, especially in distributed settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by KDD'25</p></details> |

The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation.

The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Applied Intelligence for review</p></details> |

This challenge stems from two key issues: first, incorporating spatial-temporal localization introduces a vast number of coordinate combinations, complicating the alignment of linguistic and visual coordinate representations; second, encoding fine-grained temporal and spatial information during video feature compression is inherently difficult. To address these issues, we propose LLaVA-ST, a MLLM for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. In LLaVA-ST, we propose Language-Aligned Positional Embedding, which embeds the textual coordinate special token into the visual space, simplifying the alignment of fine-grained spatial-temporal correspondences. Additionally, we design the Spatial-Temporal Packer, which decouples the feature compression of temporal and spatial resolutions into two distinct point-to-region attention processing streams. Furthermore, we propose ST-Align dataset with 4.3M training samples for fine-grained spatial-temporal multimodal understanding. With ST-align, we present a progressive training pipeline that aligns the visual and textual feature through sequential coarse-to-fine stages.Additionally, we introduce an ST-Align benchmark to evaluate spatial-temporal interleaved fine-grained understanding tasks, which include Spatial-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) , Event Localization and Captioning (ELC) and Spatial Video Grounding (SVG).

We use excursion sets above threshold exceedances in data observed over a two-dimensional grid of rectangular pixels to propose a general family of coefficients that assess spatial-extent properties relevant for risk assessment, and study five candidate coefficients from this family. These coefficients are defined locally and interpreted as a spatial distance from a reference site where the threshold is exceeded. We develop statistical inference and discuss robustness to boundary effects and resolution of the pixel grid. To statistically extrapolate coefficients towards very high threshold levels, we formulate a semiparametric model and estimate a parameter characterizing how coefficients scale with the quantile level of the threshold. The utility of the new coefficients is illustrated through simulated data, as well as in an application to gridded daily temperature in continental France. We find notable differences in estimated coefficient maps between climate model simulations and observation-based reanalysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 10 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

This leads to a dual role for the eyes as a means of sensing and communication. Accordingly, artificial eye models are being explored as communication media in human-machine interaction scenarios. One challenge in the use of eye models for communication consists of resolving spatial reference ambiguities, especially for screen-based models. Here, we introduce an approach for overcoming this challenge through the introduction of reflection-like features that are contingent on artificial eye movements. We conducted a user study with 30 participants in which participants had to use spatial references provided by dynamic eye models to advance in a fast-paced group interaction task. Compared to a non-reflective eye model and a pure reflection mode, their combination in the new approach resulted in a higher identification accuracy and user experience, suggesting a synergistic benefit.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Robust Hyperspectral Image Panshapring via Sparse Spatial-Spectral Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07953v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution hyperspectral imaging plays a crucial role in various remote sensing applications, yet its acquisition often faces fundamental limitations due to hardware constraints. This paper introduces S$^{3}$RNet, a novel framework for hyperspectral image pansharpening that effectively combines low-resolution hyperspectral images (LRHSI) with high-resolution multispectral images (HRMSI) through sparse spatial-spectral representation. The core of S$^{3}$RNet is the Multi-Branch Fusion Network (MBFN), which employs parallel branches to capture complementary features at different spatial and spectral scales. Unlike traditional approaches that treat all features equally, our Spatial-Spectral Attention Weight Block (SSAWB) dynamically adjusts feature weights to maintain sparse representation while suppressing noise and redundancy. To enhance feature propagation, we incorporate the Dense Feature Aggregation Block (DFAB), which efficiently aggregates inputted features through dense connectivity patterns. This integrated design enables S$^{3}$RNet to selectively emphasize the most informative features from differnt scale while maintaining computational efficiency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that S$^{3}$RNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, showing particular strength in maintaining high reconstruction quality even under challenging noise conditions. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IGARSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[GeoWarp: Warped spatial processes for inferring subsea sediment properties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07841v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For offshore structures like wind turbines, subsea infrastructure, pipelines, and cables, it is crucial to quantify the properties of the seabed sediments at a proposed site. However, data collection offshore is costly, so analysis of the seabed sediments must be made from measurements that are spatially sparse. Adding to this challenge, the structure of the seabed sediments exhibits both nonstationarity and anisotropy. To address these issues, we propose GeoWarp, a hierarchical spatial statistical modeling framework for inferring the 3-D geotechnical properties of subsea sediments. GeoWarp decomposes the seabed properties into a region-wide vertical mean profile (modeled using B-splines), and a nonstationary 3-D spatial Gaussian process. Process nonstationarity and anisotropy are accommodated by warping space in three dimensions and by allowing the process variance to change with depth. We apply GeoWarp to measurements of the seabed made using cone penetrometer tests (CPTs) at six sites on the North West Shelf of Australia. We show that GeoWarp captures the complex spatial distribution of the sediment properties, and produces realistic 3-D simulations suitable for downstream engineering analyses. Through cross-validation, we show that GeoWarp has predictive performance superior to other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its value as a tool in offshore geotechnical engineering.</p></details> |  |

Traditional metrics, such as CLIP text and image scores, often fall short: text scores are limited by inadequate training data and hierarchical dependencies, while image scores fail to assess temporal consistency. We present SST-EM (Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal Evaluation Metric), a novel evaluation framework that leverages modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Object Detection, and Temporal Consistency checks. SST-EM comprises four components: (1) semantic extraction from frames using a VLM, (2) primary object tracking with Object Detection, (3) focused object refinement via an LLM agent, and (4) temporal consistency assessment using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These components are integrated into a unified metric with weights derived from human evaluations and regression analysis. The name SST-EM reflects its focus on Semantic, Spatial, and Temporal aspects of video evaluation. SST-EM provides a comprehensive evaluation of semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness in video editing.

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSTSA-GCN: Advancing Skeleton-Based Gesture Recognition with Semantic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Topology Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12086v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for skeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model spatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerability-Aware Spatio-Temporal Learning for Generalizable and Interpretable Deepfake Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01184v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging due to the complex intertwined spatial and temporal artifacts in forged sequences. Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/10Ring/FakeSTormer.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation. The results highlight the potential of combining spatial and temporal features for enhanced pain detection, offering a promising advancement in objective pain assessment methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables.

| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the prevalence of spatio-temporal data in critical domains such as transportation, public health, and environmental monitoring, spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) have not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[STORM: A Spatio-Temporal Factor Model Based on Dual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders for Financial Trading](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09468v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In financial trading, factor models are widely used to price assets and capture excess returns from mispricing. Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[Self-Attentive Spatio-Temporal Calibration for Precise Intermediate Layer Matching in ANN-to-SNN Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08049v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for low-power computation due to their event-driven mechanism but often suffer from lower accuracy compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

However, traditional prediction methods are often limited by static spatial modeling, making it difficult to accurately capture the dynamic and complex relationships between time and space, thereby affecting prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an innovative traffic flow prediction network, SFADNet, which categorizes traffic flow into multiple traffic patterns based on temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SFADNet outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |

However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos.

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |

However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization.

| **[Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Land Surface Temperature Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16631v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in satellite remote sensing have enhanced the capability to monitor and analyze the Earth's surface. Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |
| **[Clustering Time-Evolving Networks Using the Spatio-Temporal Graph Laplacian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12864v3)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-evolving graphs arise frequently when modeling complex dynamical systems such as social networks, traffic flow, and biological processes. Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

| **[2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12789v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The freshness of sensor data is critical for all types of cyber-physical systems. An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Levy-Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Process: Towards Big Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08451v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this era of big data, all scientific disciplines are evolving fast to cope up with the enormity of the available information. So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |
| **[STDHL: Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Hypergraph Learning for Wind Power Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11393v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging spatio-temporal correlations among wind farms can significantly enhance the accuracy of ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the lagged correlations converge to zero as the spatio-temporal lag goes to infinity. We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process, including its continuity and smoothness properties. We derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC techniques in the Bayesian paradigm. The performance of our method has been compared with that of a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) using two simulation studies, where our method shows a significant improvement over the non-stationary GP.

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Challenges in Spatio-temporal Modelling of Antarctic Krill Abundance: Addressing Zero-inflated Data and Misaligned Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01399v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are among the most abundant species on our planet and serve as a vital food source for many marine predators in the Southern Ocean. In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to accurately model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published on Tomography</p></details> |

We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</p></details> | 17 pages,6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Online Continual Learning for Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15893v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-Video Instance Segmentation (YouTube-VIS) 2019/2021 and Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |

While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability.

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |

These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Communication Compression in Distributed Prime-Dual Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02332v2)** | 2024-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study distributed prime-dual flows for multi-agent optimization with spatio-temporal compressions. The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Adversarial Networks for Spatio-Spectral Compression of Hyperspectral Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08514v4)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of deep learning-based models for the compression of hyperspectral images (HSIs) has recently attracted great attention in remote sensing due to the sharp growing of hyperspectral data archives. Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality. The code of the proposed models is publicly available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/HSI-SSC .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 14th IEEE GRSS Workshop on Hyperspectral Image and Signal Processing: Evolution in Remote Sensing (WHISPERS), 2024</p></details> |

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |
| **[Cross Space and Time: A Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09251v1)** | 2024-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting spatio-temporal traffic flow presents significant challenges due to complex interactions between spatial and temporal factors. Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Constrained Transformer with Efficient Global Relation Modelling for Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06836v1)** | 2024-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for the sustainable development of smart cities. However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

It is applied to several issues such that risk management and volatility surface calibration. This paper deals with the problem of global parameter estimations in this model. Our main stochastic results are about the stationarity and the ergodicity of the double Heston process.

| **[Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08099v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |

By utilizing B-Splines Finite Elements Exterior Calculus, we derive a space discretization that preserves the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the model, and we study two stable time-splitting geometrical integrators. We approximate an incoming wave boundary condition in such a way that the resulting schemes are compatible with a time-harmonic / transient decomposition of the solution, which allows us to establish their long-time stability. This approach readily applies to curvilinear and complex domains. We perform a numerical study of these schemes which compares their cost and accuracy against a standard Crank-Nicolson time integrator, and we run realistic simulations where the long-term behaviour is assessed using frequency-domain solutions. Our solvers are implemented in the Python library Psydac which makes them memory-efficient, parallel and essentially three-dimensional.</p></details> | 32 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19927v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the problem of finding a consensus point in the state space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) for a multi-agent system that is comprised of $N$ identical double integrator agents. It is assumed that each agent operates under constrained control input (i.e., $|u_i(t)| \leq 1$ $\forall i = 1, \hdots N$). Further, a fixed fuel budget is also assumed i.e., the total amount of cumulative input that can be expended is limited by $\int_0^{t_f}|u(t)|dt \le \beta$. First, the attainable set $\mathcal{A}(t,x_0,\beta)$ at time $t$, which is the set of all states that an agent can attain starting from initial conditions $x_0$ under the fuel budget constraints at time $t$ is computed for every agent. This attainable set is a convex set for all $t\ge0$. Then the minimum time to consensus is the minimum time $\bar{t}$ at which attainable sets of all agents intersect, and the consensus point is the point of intersection. A closed-form expression for the minimum time consensus point is provided for the case of three agents. Then, using Helly's theorem, the intersection will be non-empty at a time when all the $N \choose 3$ triplets of agents have non-empty intersection. The computation of minimum time consensus for all $N \choose 3$ triplets is performed independently and can be distributed among all the $N$ agents. Finally, the overall minimum time to consensus is given by the triplet that has the highest minimum time to consensus. Further, the intersection of all the attainable sets of this triplet gives the minimum time consensus point for all $N$ agents.</p></details> |  |

However, their application in the energy and smart grid sector remains limited due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of high-quality data. In this work, we propose a method for creating high-fidelity electricity consumption time series data for rare and unseen context variables (e.g. location, building type, photovoltaics). Our approach, Context Encoding and Normalizing Time Series Generation, or CENTS, includes three key innovations: (i) A context normalization approach that enables inverse transformation for time series context variables unseen during training, (ii) a novel context encoder to condition any state-of-the-art time-series generator on arbitrary numbers and combinations of context variables, (iii) a framework for training this context encoder jointly with a time-series generator using an auxiliary context classification loss designed to increase expressivity of context embeddings and improve model performance. We further provide a comprehensive overview of different evaluation metrics for generative time series models. Our results highlight the efficacy of the proposed method in generating realistic household-level electricity consumption data, paving the way for training larger foundation models in the energy domain on synthetic as well as real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Explainable NILM: Real-Time Event-Based NILM Framework for High-Frequency Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16841v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an advanced, and cost-effective technique for monitoring appliance-level energy consumption. However, its adaptability is hindered by the lack of transparency and explainability. To address this challenge, this paper presents an explainable, real-time, event-based NILM framework specifically designed for high-frequency datasets. The proposed framework ensures transparency at every stage by integrating a z-score-based event detector, appliance signature estimation, Fourier-based feature extraction, an XG-Boost classifier, and post hoc SHAP analysis. The SHAP analysis further quantifies the contribution of individual features, such as cosine of specific harmonic phases, to appliance classification. The framework is trained and evaluated on the PLAID dataset, and achieved a classification accuracy of 90% while maintaining low computational requirements and a latency of less than one second.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Real-Time Traffic Flow Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16758v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient management of traffic flow in urban environments presents a significant challenge, exacerbated by dynamic changes and the sheer volume of data generated by modern transportation networks. Traditional centralized traffic management systems often struggle with scalability and privacy concerns, hindering their effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) to create a decentralized, scalable, and adaptive traffic management system. Our approach, termed Meta-Federated Learning, leverages the distributed nature of FL to process data locally at the edge, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing latency. Simultaneously, ML enables the system to quickly adapt to new traffic conditions without the need for extensive retraining. We implement our model across a simulated network of smart traffic devices, demonstrating that Meta-Federated Learning significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and response time. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable adaptability to sudden changes in traffic patterns, suggesting a scalable solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities. This study not only paves the way for more resilient urban traffic systems but also exemplifies the potential of integrated FL and ML in other real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08193v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[PLANSIEVE: Real-time Suboptimal Query Plan Detection Through Incremental Refinements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16544v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cardinality estimation remains a fundamental challenge in query optimization, often resulting in sub-optimal execution plans and degraded performance. While errors in cardinality estimation are inevitable, existing methods for identifying sub-optimal plans -- such as metrics like Q-error, P-error, or L1-error -- are limited to post-execution analysis, requiring complete knowledge of true cardinalities and failing to prevent the execution of sub-optimal plans in real-time. This paper introduces PLANSIEVE, a novel framework that identifies sub-optimal plans during query optimization. PLANSIEVE operates by analyzing the relative order of sub-plans generated by the optimizer based on estimated and true cardinalities. It begins with surrogate cardinalities from any third-party estimator and incrementally refines these surrogates as the system processes more queries. Experimental results on the augmented JOB-LIGHT-SCALE and STATS-CEB-SCALE workloads demonstrate that PLANSIEVE achieves an accuracy of up to 88.7\% in predicting sub-optimal plans.</p></details> |  |
| **[dApps: Enabling Real-Time AI-Based Open RAN Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16502v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Radio Access Networks (RANs) leverage disaggregated and programmable RAN functions and open interfaces to enable closed-loop, data-driven radio resource management. This is performed through custom intelligent applications on the RAN Intelligent Controllers (RICs), optimizing RAN policy scheduling, network slicing, user session management, and medium access control, among others. In this context, we have proposed dApps as a key extension of the O-RAN architecture into the real-time and user-plane domains. Deployed directly on RAN nodes, dApps access data otherwise unavailable to RICs due to privacy or timing constraints, enabling the execution of control actions within shorter time intervals. In this paper, we propose for the first time a reference architecture for dApps, defining their life cycle from deployment by the Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to real-time control loop interactions with the RAN nodes where they are hosted. We introduce a new dApp interface, E3, along with an Application Protocol (AP) that supports structured message exchanges and extensible communication for various service models. By bridging E3 with the existing O-RAN E2 interface, we enable dApps, xApps, and rApps to coexist and coordinate. These applications can then collaborate on complex use cases and employ hierarchical control to resolve shared resource conflicts. Finally, we present and open-source a dApp framework based on OpenAirInterface (OAI). We benchmark its performance in two real-time control use cases, i.e., spectrum sharing and positioning in a 5th generation (5G) Next Generation Node Base (gNB) scenario. Our experimental results show that standardized real-time control loops via dApps are feasible, achieving average control latency below 450 microseconds and allowing optimal use of shared spectral resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Combined, these issues make forecasting from short time series particularly challenging. To address this problem, we introduce Meta-learning for Tailored Forecasting from Related Time Series (METAFORS), which uses related systems with longer time-series data to supplement limited data from the system of interest. By leveraging a library of models trained on related systems, METAFORS builds tailored models to forecast system evolution with limited data. Using a reservoir computing implementation and testing on simulated chaotic systems, we demonstrate METAFORS' ability to predict both short-term dynamics and long-term statistics, even when test and related systems exhibit significantly different behaviors and the available data are scarce, highlighting its robustness and versatility in data-limited scenarios.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/LancelotXWX/SWIFT.</p></details> |  |

However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin & Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, most approaches require the motion to be known in advance so that it can be included in the space-time mesh. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to use the well-known air-gap element for the rotor-stator coupling of an isogeometric machine model. First, we derive the solution in the air-gap region and then employ it to couple the rotor and stator. This coupling is angle dependent and we show how to efficiently update the coupling matrices to a different angle, avoiding expensive quadrature. Finally, the resulting time-dependent problem is solved in a space-time setting. The spatial discretization using isogeometric analysis is particularly suitable for coupling via the air-gap element, as NURBS can exactly represent the geometry of the air-gap. Furthermore, the model including the air-gap element can be seamlessly transferred to the space-time setting. However, the air-gap element is well known in the literature. The originality of this work is the application to isogeometric analysis and space-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Projection-Free Online Learning with Time-Varying Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16046v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate constrained online convex optimization, in which decisions must belong to a fixed and typically complicated domain, and are required to approximately satisfy additional time-varying constraints over the long term. In this setting, the commonly used projection operations are often computationally expensive or even intractable. To avoid the time-consuming operation, several projection-free methods have been proposed with an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4} \sqrt{\log T})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{7/8})$ cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bound for general convex losses. In this paper, we improve this result and further establish \textit{novel} regret and CCV bounds when loss functions are strongly convex. The primary idea is to first construct a composite surrogate loss, involving the original loss and constraint functions, by utilizing the Lyapunov-based technique. Then, we propose a parameter-free variant of the classical projection-free method, namely online Frank-Wolfe (OFW), and run this new extension over the online-generated surrogate loss. Theoretically, for general convex losses, we achieve an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4} \log T)$ CCV bound, both of which are order-wise tighter than existing results. For strongly convex losses, we establish new guarantees of an $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ CCV bound. Moreover, we also extend our methods to a more challenging setting with bandit feedback, obtaining similar theoretical findings. Empirically, experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[COBias and Debias: Balancing Class Accuracies for Language Models in Inference Time via Nonlinear Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07623v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are good knowledge bases but struggle to perform equally well for all classes in text classification tasks. This paper investigates a fundamental inference-time problem in language models: imbalanced class accuracies. We find what's underneath the issue is a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting some others. This class accuracy imbalance is difficult to solve from the root via better pre-training or fine-tuning strategies, but we show it can be effectively mitigated via inference-time combinatorial optimization. To this end, we conceptualize and quantify the over- and under-prediction issue as the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), and propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) model to correct in-context learned class probabilities based on minimizing COBias and maximizing overall accuracy, without LLM parameter update. Considering that the DNIP model implicitly contains non-differentiable elements, we therefore use the simulated annealing algorithm to solve it. Extensive evaluations on three LLMs across seven NLP classification tasks in different prompting settings show that DNIP simultaneously achieves significant COBias reduction (-27%) and accuracy improvement (+12%) over the conventional ICL approach, suggesting that inference-time mitigation of class accuracy imbalance is a promising direction to push forward LLM performances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Brain Tumor Detection in Intraoperative Ultrasound Using YOLO11: From Model Training to Deployment in the Operating Room](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15994v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative ultrasound (ioUS) is a valuable tool in brain tumor surgery due to its versatility, affordability, and seamless integration into the surgical workflow. However, its adoption remains limited, primarily because of the challenges associated with image interpretation and the steep learning curve required for effective use. This study aimed to enhance the interpretability of ioUS images by developing a real-time brain tumor detection system deployable in the operating room. We collected 2D ioUS images from the Brain Tumor Intraoperative Database (BraTioUS) and the public ReMIND dataset, annotated with expert-refined tumor labels. Using the YOLO11 architecture and its variants, we trained object detection models to identify brain tumors. The dataset included 1,732 images from 192 patients, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Data augmentation expanded the training set to 11,570 images. In the test dataset, YOLO11s achieved the best balance of precision and computational efficiency, with a mAP@50 of 0.95, mAP@50-95 of 0.65, and a processing speed of 34.16 frames per second. The proposed solution was prospectively validated in a cohort of 15 consecutively operated patients diagnosed with brain tumors.

This prevents analyzing and even formalizing the stability and control problems for open multi-agent systems whose agents may enter or leave the network, industrial processes where the sensors or actuators may be exchanged frequently, smart grids, etc. In this work, we propose a framework of live systems that covers a rather general class of systems with a time-varying state space. We argue that input-to-state stability is a proper stability notion for this class of systems, and many of the classic tools and results, such as Lyapunov methods and superposition theorems, can be extended to this setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiPDENet: PDE-embedded Learning with Multi-time-stepping for Accelerated Flow Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15987v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by numerical methods meet computational cost challenge for getting the accurate solution since fine grids and small time steps are required. Machine learning can accelerate this process, but struggle with weak generalizability, interpretability, and data dependency, as well as suffer in long-term prediction. To this end, we propose a PDE-embedded network with multiscale time stepping (MultiPDENet), which fuses the scheme of numerical methods and machine learning, for accelerated simulation of flows. In particular, we design a convolutional filter based on the structure of finite difference stencils with a small number of parameters to optimize, which estimates the equivalent form of spatial derivative on a coarse grid to minimize the equation's residual. A Physics Block with a 4th-order Runge-Kutta integrator at the fine time scale is established that embeds the structure of PDEs to guide the prediction. To alleviate the curse of temporal error accumulation in long-term prediction, we introduce a multiscale time integration approach, where a neural network is used to correct the prediction error at a coarse time scale. Experiments across various PDE systems, including the Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrate that MultiPDENet can accurately predict long-term spatiotemporal dynamics, even given small and incomplete training data, e.g., spatiotemporally down-sampled datasets. MultiPDENet achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with other neural baseline models, also with clear speedup compared to classical numerical methods.</p></details> |  |

The scheme allows data producers to share their content in encrypted form before transmitting it to consumers. The encryption mechanism incorporates time-based subscription access policies directly into the encrypted content, enabling only consumers with valid subscriptions to decrypt it. This makes the scheme well-suited for real-world, subscription-based applications like Netflix. Additionally, the scheme introduces an anonymous and unlinkable signature-based authentication mechanism that empowers edge routers to block bogus content requests at the network's entry point, thereby mitigating Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. A formal security proof demonstrates the scheme's resistance to Chosen Plaintext Attacks (CPA). Performance analysis, using Mini-NDN-based emulation and a Charm library implementation, further confirms the practicality of the scheme. Moreover, it outperforms closely related works in terms of functionality, security, and communication overhead.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114v4)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI'25 |

Flexibility of loads, such as aggregate smart charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs), is increasingly leveraged to manage grid congestion through various market-based mechanisms. Under such an arrangement, this paper quantifies the effect of lead time on the aggregate flexibility of EV fleets. Simulations using real-world charging transactions spanning over different categories of charging stations are performed for two flexibility products (redispatch and capacity limitations) when offered along with different business-as-usual (BAU) schedules. Results show that the variation of tradable flexibility depends mainly on the BAU schedules, the duration of the requested flexibility, and its start time. Further, the implication of these flexibility products on the average energy costs and emissions is also studied for different cases. Simulations show that bidirectional (V2G) charging outperforms unidirectional smart charging in all cases.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Unfortunately, they are notoriously difficult, and undecidable in general. As a consequence, one-clock WTGs have attracted a lot of attention, especially because they are known to be decidable when only non-negative weights are allowed. However, when arbitrary weights are considered, despite several recent works, their decidability status was still unknown. In this paper, we solve this problem positively and show that the value function can be computed in exponential time (if weights are encoded in unary).</p></details> |  |

Inspired by large language models, there is interest in developing large time series models (LTM) to address these issues. However, current methods struggle with training complexity, adapting human feedback, and achieving high predictive accuracy. We introduce TimeHF, a novel pipeline for creating LTMs with 6 billion parameters, incorporating human feedback. We use patch convolutional embedding to capture long time series information and design a human feedback mechanism called time-series policy optimization. Deployed in JD.com's supply chain, TimeHF handles automated replenishment for over 20,000 products, improving prediction accuracy by 33.21% over existing methods. This work advances LTM technology and shows significant industrial benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial time sampling from log-smooth distributions in fixed dimension under semi-log-concavity of the forward diffusion with application to strongly dissipative distributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00565v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we provide a stochastic sampling algorithm with polynomial complexity in fixed dimension that leverages the recent advances on diffusion models where it is shown that under mild conditions, sampling can be achieved via an accurate estimation of intermediate scores across the marginals $(p_t)_{t\ge 0}$ of the standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process started at $\mu$, the density we wish to sample from. The heart of our method consists into approaching these scores via a computationally cheap estimator and relating the variance of this estimator to the smoothness properties of the forward process. Under the assumption that the density to sample from is $L$-log-smooth and that the forward process is semi-log-concave: $-\nabla^2 \log(p_t) \succeq -\beta I_d$ for some $\beta \geq 0$, we prove that our algorithm achieves an expected $\epsilon$ error in $\text{KL}$ divergence in $O(d^7(L+\beta)^2L^{d+2}\epsilon^{-2(d+3)}(d+m_2(\mu))^{2(d+1)})$ time with $m_2(\mu)$ the second order moment of $\mu$. In particular, our result allows to fully transfer the problem of sampling from a log-smooth distribution into a regularity estimate problem. As an application, we derive an exponential complexity improvement for the problem of sampling from an $L$-log-smooth distribution that is $\alpha$-strongly log-concave outside some ball of radius $R$: after proving that such distributions verify the semi-log-concavity assumption, a result which might be of independent interest, we recover a $poly(R, L, \alpha^{-1}, \epsilon^{-1})$ complexity in fixed dimension which exponentially improves upon the previously known $poly(e^{LR^2}, L,\alpha^{-1}, \log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ complexity in the low precision regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimax rates of convergence for the nonparametric estimation of the diffusion coefficient from time-homogeneous SDE paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15933v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consider a diffusion process X, solution of a time-homogeneous stochastic differential equation. We assume that the diffusion process X is observed at discrete times, at high frequency, which means that the time step tends toward zero. In addition, the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process X are assumed to be unknown. In this paper, we study the minimax rates of convergence of the nonparametric estimators of the square of the diffusion coefficient. Two observation schemes are considered depending on the estimation interval. The square of the diffusion coefficient is estimated on the real line from repeated observations of the process X, where the number of diffusion paths tends to infinity. For the case of a compact estimation interval, we study the nonparametric estimation of the square of the diffusion coefficient constructed from a single diffusion path on one side and from repeated observations on the other side, where the number of trajectories tends to infinity. In each of these cases, we establish minimax convergence rates of the risk of estimation of the diffusion coefficient over a space of Holder functions.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[Minimax rates of convergence of a binary classification procedure for time-homogeneous S.D.E paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15926v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of binary classification of trajectories generated by time-homogeneous stochastic differential equations, we consider a mixture model of two diffusion processes characterized by a stochastic differential equation whose drift coefficient depends on the class or label, which is modeled as a discrete random variable taking two possible values, and whose diffusion coefficient is independent of the class. We assume that the drift and diffusion coefficients are unknown as well as the law of the discrete random variable that models the class. In this paper, we study the minimax convergence rate of the resulting nonparametric plug-in classifier under different sets of assumptions on the mixture model considered. As the plug-in classifier is based on nonparametric estimators of the coefficients of the mixture model, we also provide a minimax convergence rate of the risk of estimation of the drift coefficients on the real line.</p></details> | 36 pages |

By extending the Spline Upwind method and exploiting low-rank matrix approximations, as well as preconditioned solvers, we achieve both significant computational efficiency and accuracy. In particular, we develop a formulation that is both simple and highly effective, designed to minimize spurious oscillations and ensuring computational efficiency. We rigorously validate the method's performance through a series of numerical experiments, showing its robustness and reliability in diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05335v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</p></details> | Accepted at IEEE TSP |
| **[DynaPrompt: Dynamic Test-Time Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16404v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time prompt tuning enhances zero-shot generalization of vision-language models but tends to ignore the relatedness among test samples during inference. Online test-time prompt tuning provides a simple way to leverage the information in previous test samples, albeit with the risk of prompt collapse due to error accumulation. To enhance test-time prompt tuning, we propose DynaPrompt, short for dynamic test-time prompt tuning, exploiting relevant data distribution information while reducing error accumulation. Built on an online prompt buffer, DynaPrompt adaptively selects and optimizes the relevant prompts for each test sample during tuning. Specifically, we introduce a dynamic prompt selection strategy based on two metrics: prediction entropy and probability difference. For unseen test data information, we develop dynamic prompt appending, which allows the buffer to append new prompts and delete the inactive ones. By doing so, the prompts are optimized to exploit beneficial information on specific test data, while alleviating error accumulation. Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic test-time prompt tuning.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Long-Term Interest Clock: Fine-Grained Time Perception in Streaming Recommendation System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15817v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User interests manifest a dynamic pattern within the course of a day, e.g., a user usually favors soft music at 8 a.m. but may turn to ambient music at 10 p.m. To model dynamic interests in a day, hour embedding is widely used in traditional daily-trained industrial recommendation systems. However, its discreteness can cause periodical online patterns and instability in recent streaming recommendation systems. Recently, Interest Clock has achieved remarkable performance in streaming recommendation systems. Nevertheless, it models users' dynamic interests in a coarse-grained manner, merely encoding users' discrete interests of 24 hours from short-term behaviors. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained method for perceiving time information for streaming recommendation systems, named Long-term Interest Clock (LIC). The key idea of LIC is adaptively calculating current user interests by taking into consideration the relevance of long-term behaviors around current time (e.g., 8 a.m.) given a candidate item. LIC consists of two modules: (1) Clock-GSU retrieves a sub-sequence by searching through long-term behaviors, using query information from a candidate item and current time, (2) Clock-ESU employs a time-gap-aware attention mechanism to aggregate sub-sequence with the candidate item. With Clock-GSU and Clock-ESU, LIC is capable of capturing users' dynamic fine-grained interests from long-term behaviors. We conduct online A/B tests, obtaining +0.122% improvements on user active days. Besides, the extended offline experiments show improvements as well. Long-term Interest Clock has been integrated into Douyin Music App's recommendation system.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW2025 |
| **[Introducing RIFT: A Hierarchical Entropic Filtering Scheme for Ideal Time-Frequency Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15764v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Reconstructive Ideal Fractional Transform (RIFT), an entropy-based probabilistic filtering algorithm formulated to reconstruct the Ideal Time-Frequency Representation (ITFR). RIFT surpasses the limitations imposed by the Gabor uncertainty principle for linear transforms, achieving the bilinear transform accuracy present in the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WVD) while effectively suppressing cross-terms. The algorithm utilises a hierarchical fractional wavelet-based scheme to account for localised time-frequency trajectory curvature. This scheme is optimised through an entropic-based filtering method that probabilistically extracts auto-terms while retaining the resolution of the WVD. This is achieved by employing a spatially varying, positively constrained deconvolution algorithm (Lucy-Richardson) with regularisation for adequate noise suppression. Additionally, the optimisation yields an Instantaneous Phase Direction field, which allows the localised curvature in speech or music extracts to be visualised and utilised within a Kalman tracking scheme, enabling the extraction of signal component trajectories. Evaluation demonstrates the algorithm's ability to eradicate cross-terms effectively and achieve superior time-frequency precision. This advance holds significant potential for a wide range of applications requiring high-resolution cross-term-free time-frequency analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, its visual-centric design poses significant challenges for blind and low vision (BLV) viewers. Our formative study identified three primary challenges that hinder BLV viewers' engagement with Danmu: the lack of visual context, the speech interference between comments and videos, and the disorganization of comments. To address these challenges, we present DanmuA11y, a system that makes Danmu accessible by transforming it into multi-viewer audio discussions. DanmuA11y incorporates three core features: (1) Augmenting Danmu with visual context, (2) Seamlessly integrating Danmu into videos, and (3) Presenting Danmu via multi-viewer discussions. Evaluation with twelve BLV viewers demonstrated that DanmuA11y significantly improved Danmu comprehension, provided smooth viewing experiences, and fostered social connections among viewers. We further highlight implications for enhancing commentary accessibility in video-based social media and live-streaming platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous-Time Zeroth-Order Dynamics with Projection Maps: Model-Free Feedback Optimization with Safety Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06858v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a class of model-free feedback methods for solving generic constrained optimization problems where the specific mathematical forms of the objective and constraint functions are not available. The proposed methods, termed Projected Zeroth-Order (P-ZO) dynamics, incorporate projection maps into a class of continuous-time model-free dynamics that make use of periodic dithering for the purpose of gradient learning. In particular, the proposed P-ZO algorithms can be interpreted as new extremum-seeking algorithms that autonomously drive an unknown system toward a neighborhood of the set of solutions of an optimization problem using only output feedback, while systematically guaranteeing that the input trajectories remain in a feasible set for all times. In this way, the P-ZO algorithms can properly handle hard and asymptotical constraints in model-free optimization problems without using penalty terms or barrier functions. Moreover, the proposed dynamics have suitable robustness properties with respect to small bounded additive disturbances on the states and dynamics, a property that is fundamental for practical real-world implementations. Additional tracking results for time-varying and switching cost functions are also derived under stronger convexity and smoothness assumptions and using tools from hybrid dynamical systems. Numerical examples are presented throughout the paper to illustrate the above results.</p></details> | 17 pages |

In this work, we propose a new architecture StagFormer (Staggered Transformer), which staggered execution along the time axis and thereby enables parallelizing the decoding process along the depth of the model. We achieve this by breaking the dependency of the token representation at time step $i$ in layer $l$ upon the representations of tokens until time step $i$ from layer $l-1$. Instead, we stagger the execution and only allow a dependency on token representations until time step $i-1$. The later sections of the Transformer still get access to the ``rich" representations from the prior section but only from those token positions which are one time step behind. StagFormer allows for different sections of the model to be executed in parallel yielding at potential 33\% speedup in decoding while being quality neutral in our simulations. We also explore many natural variants of this idea. We present how weight-sharing across the different sections being staggered can be more practical in settings with limited memory. We show how one can approximate a recurrent model during inference using such weight-sharing. We explore the efficacy of using a bounded window attention to pass information from one section to another which helps drive further latency gains for some applications. We also explore demonstrate the scalability of the staggering idea over more than 2 sections of the Transformer.</p></details> |  |

Their randomized initialization, a computational benefit, results in drawbacks in theoretical analysis of large random graphs, because of which deterministic variations are an still open field of research. Building upon Next-Gen Reservoir Computing and the Temporal Convolution Derived Reservoir Computing, we propose a deterministic alternative to the higher-dimensional mapping therein, TCRC-LM and TCRC-CM, utilizing the parametrized but deterministic Logistic mapping and Chebyshev maps. To further enhance the predictive capabilities in the task of time series forecasting, we propose the novel utilization of the Lobachevsky function as non-linear activation function. As a result, we observe a new, fully deterministic network being able to outperform TCRCs and classical Reservoir Computing in the form of the prominent Echo State Networks by up to $99.99\%$ for the non-chaotic time series and $87.13\%$ for the chaotic ones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG < 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG > 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict blood glucose (BG) levels in ICU patients. Unlike existing approaches that rely on manual feature engineering or are limited to a small number of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST demonstrates the feasibility of integrating diverse clinical data (e.g., lab results, medications, vital signs) and handling irregular time-series data without predefined aggregation. MITST employs a hierarchical architecture of Transformers, comprising feature-level, timestamp-level, and source-level components, to capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and enable learning-based data integration. This eliminates the need for traditional aggregation and manual feature engineering. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p < 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p < 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly outperforming the baseline. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures V2: Updated the title and abstract.

An Ambient backscatter tag broadcasts its message by backscattering ambient downlink waves from the closest base station according to a predefined pattern. A tag is detected by smartphones nearby. This paper presents, for the first time, a novel ambient backscatter communication system exploiting uplink ambient waves from smartphones instead of downlink waves. In this novel system, the base station connected to a smartphone monitors the uplink pilot signals and detects tags in proximity. The proposed system is implemented and tested with prototypes of tags, a commercial 4G smartphone and a 4G Software Defined Radio base station. At the base station side, a non-coherent correlator receiver is implemented, and a novel technique based on pre-correlation data processing is proposed to separate useful variations on pilot signals due to tags from variations due to time varying channel effects. To deal with collision between multiple tags, distinct Gold pseudo noise codes with minimum cross correlation are used. Tests are run in different indoor and outdoor environments. A receiver detection probability of 95% has been achieved at 0.5% False-alarm probability when the tag is at 5 meters from the UE. At the refresh rate of 2 seconds, the proposed scheme is suitable for tracking objects at moderate speeds and can therefore be used for many passive IoT-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 16 figures, submitted to JRFID (under review)</p></details> |

More in detail, within the context of a generic Finite Volume (FV) semidiscretization, we consider Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The goal of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we want to demonstrate the possibility of utilizing very high order schemes in concrete situations and highlight the related advantages. On the other one, we want to debunk the myth according to which, in the context of numerical resolution of hyperbolic PDEs with very high order spatial discretizations, the adoption of lower order time discretizations, e.g., strong stability preserving (SSP) or linearly strong stability preserving ($\ell SSP$) Runge--Kutta (RK) schemes, does not affect the overall accuracy of the resulting approach and consequently its computational efficiency. Numerical results are reported for the linear advection equation (LAE) and for the Euler equations of fluid dynamics, showing the advantages and the critical aspects of the adoption of very high order numerical methods. Overall, the results indicate the potential for their use in real--life applications, offering advantages in terms of efficiency, such as requiring shorter computational times to achieve a prescribed error, even in problems involving discontinuities. Furthermore, the results confirm order degradation and efficiency loss when coupling very high order space discretizations with lower order SSPRK time discretizations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods ignore the complexity and dynamism of real-world traffic systems, resulting in significant gaps in efficiency and accuracy in real-time scenarios. Addressing this issue is a critical yet challenging task. This paper proposes a novel framework that redefines the implementation path of ER-TTE to achieve highly efficient and effective predictions. Firstly, we introduce a novel pipeline consisting of a Decision Maker and a Predictor to rectify the inefficient prediction strategies of current methods. The Decision Maker performs efficient real-time decisions to determine whether the high-complexity prediction model in the Predictor needs to be invoked, and the Predictor recalculates the travel time or infers from historical prediction results based on these decisions. Next, to tackle the dynamic and uncertain real-time scenarios, we model the online decision-making problem as a Markov decision process and design an intelligent agent based on reinforcement learning for autonomous decision-making. Moreover, to fully exploit the spatio-temporal correlation between online data and offline data, we meticulously design feature representation and encoding techniques based on the attention mechanism. Finally, to improve the flawed training and evaluation strategies of existing methods, we propose an end-to-end training and evaluation approach, incorporating curriculum learning strategies to manage spatio-temporal data for more advanced training algorithms. Extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets confirm that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |
| **[Cooperative Cruising: Reinforcement Learning-Based Time-Headway Control for Increased Traffic Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02520v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of connected automated vehicles represents an unprecedented opportunity for improving driving efficiency and alleviating traffic congestion. However, existing research fails to address realistic multi-lane highway scenarios without assuming connectivity, perception, and control capabilities that are typically unavailable in current vehicles. This paper proposes a novel AI system that is the first to improve highway traffic efficiency compared with human-like traffic in realistic, simulated multi-lane scenarios, while relying on existing connectivity, perception, and control capabilities. At the core of our approach is a reinforcement learning based controller that dynamically communicates time-headways to automated vehicles near bottlenecks based on real-time traffic conditions. These desired time-headways are then used by adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems to adjust their following distance. By (i) integrating existing traffic estimation technology and low-bandwidth vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity, (ii) leveraging safety-certified ACC systems, and (iii) targeting localized bottleneck challenges that can be addressed independently in different locations, we propose a potentially practical, safe, and scalable system that can positively impact numerous road users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Safe Active Learning for Real-Time Decision-Making: Pretrained Neural Policies from Simulated Nonparametric Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15458v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active Learning (AL) is a sequential learning approach aiming at selecting the most informative data for model training. In many systems, safety constraints appear during data evaluation, requiring the development of safe AL methods. Key challenges of AL are the repeated model training and acquisition optimization required for data selection, which become particularly restrictive under safety constraints. This repeated effort often creates a bottleneck, especially in physical systems requiring real-time decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel amortized safe AL framework. By leveraging a pretrained neural network policy, our method eliminates the need for repeated model training and acquisition optimization, achieving substantial speed improvements while maintaining competitive learning outcomes and safety awareness. The policy is trained entirely on synthetic data utilizing a novel safe AL objective. The resulting policy is highly versatile and adapts to a wide range of systems, as we demonstrate in our experiments. Furthermore, our framework is modular and we empirically show that we also achieve superior performance for unconstrained time-sensitive AL tasks if we omit the safety requirement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part of the content published earlier at arXiv:2407.17992</p></details> |
| **[Guaranteed Multidimensional Time Series Prediction via Deterministic Tensor Completion Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15388v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the prediction of multidimensional time series data has become increasingly important due to its wide-ranging applications. Tensor-based prediction methods have gained attention for their ability to preserve the inherent structure of such data. However, existing approaches, such as tensor autoregression and tensor decomposition, often have consistently failed to provide clear assertions regarding the number of samples that can be exactly predicted. While matrix-based methods using nuclear norms address this limitation, their reliance on matrices limits accuracy and increases computational costs when handling multidimensional data. To overcome these challenges, we reformulate multidimensional time series prediction as a deterministic tensor completion problem and propose a novel theoretical framework. Specifically, we develop a deterministic tensor completion theory and introduce the Temporal Convolutional Tensor Nuclear Norm (TCTNN) model. By convolving the multidimensional time series along the temporal dimension and applying the tensor nuclear norm, our approach identifies the maximum forecast horizon for exact predictions. Additionally, TCTNN achieves superior performance in prediction accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing methods across diverse real-world datasets, including climate temperature, network flow, and traffic ride data. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoShu2000/TCTNN.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Quasi Time-Optimal Nonlinear Model Predictive Control with Soft Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.02994v3)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many mechatronic applications, controller input costs are negligible and time optimality is of great importance to maximize the productivity by executing fast positioning maneuvers. As a result, the obtained control input has mostly a bang-bang nature, which excite undesired mechanical vibrations, especially in systems with flexible structures. This paper tackles the time-optimal control problem and proposes a novel approach, which explicitly addresses the vibrational behavior in the context of the receding horizon technique. Such technique is a key feature, especially for systems with a time-varying vibrational behavior. In the context of model predictive control (MPC), vibrational behavior is predicted and coped in a soft-constrained formulation, which penalize any violation of undesired vibrations. This formulation enlarges the feasibility on a wide operating range in comparison with a hard-constrained formulation. The closed-loop performance of this approach is demonstrated on a numerical example of stacker crane with high degree of flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, IFAC 2020, Berlin</p></details> |
| **[PALM: Pushing Adaptive Learning Rate Mechanisms for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10650v4)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world vision models in dynamic environments face rapid shifts in domain distributions, leading to decreased recognition performance. Using unlabeled test data, continuous test-time adaptation (CTTA) directly adjusts a pre-trained source discriminative model to these changing domains. A highly effective CTTA method involves applying layer-wise adaptive learning rates for selectively adapting pre-trained layers. However, it suffers from the poor estimation of domain shift and the inaccuracies arising from the pseudo-labels. This work aims to overcome these limitations by identifying layers for adaptation via quantifying model prediction uncertainty without relying on pseudo-labels. We utilize the magnitude of gradients as a metric, calculated by backpropagating the KL divergence between the softmax output and a uniform distribution, to select layers for further adaptation. Subsequently, for the parameters exclusively belonging to these selected layers, with the remaining ones frozen, we evaluate their sensitivity to approximate the domain shift and adjust their learning rates accordingly. We conduct extensive image classification experiments on CIFAR-10C, CIFAR-100C, and ImageNet-C, demonstrating the superior efficacy of our method compared to prior approaches.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

While it empowers individuals it also enables malicious actors to perpetrate scams such as fraudulent phone calls and user impersonations. This growing threat necessitates a robust system to protect individuals In this paper we introduce a novel real time fraud detection mechanism using Retrieval Augmented Generation technology to address this challenge on two fronts. First our system incorporates a continuously updating policy checking feature that transcribes phone calls in real time and uses RAG based models to verify that the caller is not soliciting private information thus ensuring transparency and the authenticity of the conversation. Second we implement a real time user impersonation check with a two step verification process to confirm the callers identity ensuring accountability. A key innovation of our system is the ability to update policies without retraining the entire model enhancing its adaptability. We validated our RAG based approach using synthetic call recordings achieving an accuracy of 97.98 percent and an F1score of 97.44 percent with 100 calls outperforming state of the art methods. This robust and flexible fraud detection system is well suited for real world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Restriction Time: Adaptive Restricted Mean Survival Time Methods in Clinical Trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15284v1)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Restricted mean survival time (RMST) offers a compelling nonparametric alternative to hazard ratios for right-censored time-to-event data, particularly when the proportional hazards assumption is violated. By capturing the total event-free time over a specified horizon, RMST provides an intuitive and clinically meaningful measure of absolute treatment benefit. Nonetheless, selecting the restriction time $L$ poses challenges: choosing a small $L$ can overlook late-emerging benefits, whereas a large $L$, often underestimated in its impact, may inflate variance and undermine power. We propose a novel data-driven, adaptive procedure that identifies the optimal restriction time $L^*$ from a continuous range by maximizing a criterion balancing effect size and estimation precision. Consequently, our procedure is particularly useful when the pattern of the treatment effect is unknown at the design stage. We provide a rigorous theoretical foundation that accounts for variability introduced by adaptively choosing $L^*$. To address nonregular estimation under the null, we develop two complementary strategies: a convex-hull-based estimator, and a penalized approach that further enhances power. Additionally, when restriction time candidates are defined on a discrete grid, we propose a procedure that surprisingly incurs no asymptotic penalty for selection, thus achieving oracle performance. Extensive simulations across realistic survival scenarios demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional RMST analyses and the log-rank test, achieving superior power while maintaining nominal Type I error rates. In a phase III pancreatic cancer trial with transient treatment effects, our procedure uncovers clinically meaningful benefits that standard methods overlook. Our methods are implemented in the R package AdaRMST.</p></details> |  |

Blockchain-based Time Machines for Decentralized Reveal of Locked Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05947v4)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional information reveal systems automate the release of information upon meeting specific predefined conditions, such as time or location. This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design, and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a secret sharing scheme with reveal-verifiability, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that "sends messages in the future" with highly accurate decryption times. Notably, the proposed secret sharing scheme applies to other applications requiring verifiability of revealed secret shares. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe.

However, existing models face challenges in identifying critical components for prediction, leading to limited interpretability and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose the Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), a novel Transformer-based model for multivariate time series forecasting. Ister decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, further modeling multi-periodicity and inter-series dependencies using a Dual Transformer architecture. We introduce a novel Dot-attention mechanism that improves interpretability, computational efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that Ister outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving up to 10% improvement in MSE. Moreover, Ister enables intuitive visualization of component contributions, shedding lights on model's decision process and enhancing transparency in prediction results.</p></details> |  |

To estimate the number of factors in this two-way factor model, we decompose the series into two parts: one being a non-weakly correlated series and the other being a weakly correlated noise. By comparing the difference between two series, we can construct white-noise based signal statistics to determine the number of factors in row loading matrix (column loading matrix). Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact on the accuracy of the estimation, which is caused by the interaction between the row loading matrix and the column loading matrix, we propose a transformation so that the transformed model only contains the row loading matrix (column loading matrix). We define sequences of ratios of two test statistics as signal statistics to determine the number of factors and derive the consistence of the estimation. We implement the numerical studies to examine the performance of the new methods.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework centered on a meta-planner (MP) that orchestrates multiple agents to generate planner templates that define roles and constraints. These planners produce actionable workflows of role nodes and dependency constraints, enabling advanced temporal reasoning and adaptability. MACI's three-tier architecture includes a meta-planning module for planner construction, common agents for general reasoning, and specialized agents for domain expertise. By decoupling planning from validation, it overcomes key LLM limitations. Evaluations demonstrate MACI's effective constraint satisfaction, conflict detection, and reasoning, positioning it as a robust solution for complex reasoning and planning tasks.</p></details> | 22 pages, 21 tables |
| **[The Complexity of Transitively Orienting Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06783v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a temporal network with discrete time-labels on its edges, entities and information can only ``flow'' along sequences of edges whose time-labels are non-decreasing (resp. increasing), i.e. along temporal (resp. strict temporal) paths. Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks of [Kempe, Kleinberg, Kumar, JCSS, 2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\{u,v\}$ with time-label $t$ specifies that ``$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$''. In this paper we make a first attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge can impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically, naturally extending the classical notion of a transitive orientation in static graphs, we introduce the fundamental notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we systematically investigate its algorithmic behavior. An orientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive if, whenever $u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a directed edge towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a directed edge towards $w$ with some time-label $t_3\geq t_2$. If we just demand that this implication holds whenever $t_2 > t_1$, we call the orientation strictly temporally transitive, as it is based on the strict directed temporal path from $u$ to $w$. Our main result is a conceptually simple, yet technically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast we prove that, surprisingly, it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\mathcal{G}$ is strictly transitively orientable. Additionally we introduce and investigate further related problems to temporal transitivity, notably among them the temporal transitive completion problem, for which we prove both algorithmic and hardness results.</p></details> |  |

However, applying these models to video relighting remains challenging due to the lack of paired video relighting datasets and the high demands for output fidelity and temporal consistency, further complicated by the inherent randomness of diffusion models. To address these challenges, we introduce RelightVid, a flexible framework for video relighting that can accept background video, text prompts, or environment maps as relighting conditions. Trained on in-the-wild videos with carefully designed illumination augmentations and rendered videos under extreme dynamic lighting, RelightVid achieves arbitrary video relighting with high temporal consistency without intrinsic decomposition while preserving the illumination priors of its image backbone.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequential Decision Making in Stochastic Games with Incomplete Preferences over Temporal Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16291v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that AI systems make strategic decisions aligned with the specified preferences in adversarial sequential interactions is a critical challenge for developing trustworthy AI systems, especially when the environment is stochastic and players' incomplete preferences leave some outcomes unranked. We study the problem of synthesizing preference-satisfying strategies in two-player stochastic games on graphs where players have opposite (possibly incomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We represent these goals using linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf), which enables modeling the nuances of human preferences where temporal goals need not be mutually exclusive and comparison between some goals may be unspecified. We introduce a solution concept of non-dominated almost-sure winning, which guarantees to achieve a most preferred outcome aligned with specified preferences while maintaining robustness against the adversarial behaviors of the opponent. Our results show that strategy profiles based on this concept are Nash equilibria in the game where players are risk-averse, thus providing a practical framework for evaluating and ensuring stable, preference-aligned outcomes in the game. Using a drone delivery example, we demonstrate that our contributions offer valuable insights not only for synthesizing rational behavior under incomplete preferences but also for designing games that motivate the desired behavior from the players in adversarial conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, accepted at AAAI 2025 (AI alignment track)</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of [A. Longa, G. Cencetti, B. Lepri, and A. Passerini, An efficient procedure for mining egocentric temporal motifs, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 36, 355 (2022)]. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |

These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than several specialist models trained to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single image instruction-following model on scene classification, visual question answering, and captioning.

However, existing remote sensing change detection (RSCD) approaches based on Mamba frequently struggle to effectively perceive the inherent locality of change regions as they direct flatten and scan RS images (i.e., the features of the same region of changes are not distributed continuously within the sequence but are mixed with features from other regions throughout the sequence). In this paper, we propose a novel locally adaptive SSM-based approach, termed CD-Lamba, which effectively enhances the locality of change detection while maintaining global perception. Specifically, our CD-Lamba includes a Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (LASS) strategy for locality enhancement, a Cross-Temporal State-Space Scan (CTSS) strategy for bi-temporal feature fusion, and a Window Shifting and Perception (WSP) mechanism to enhance interactions across segmented windows. These strategies are integrated into a multi-scale Cross-Temporal Locally Adaptive State-Space Scan (CT-LASS) module to effectively highlight changes and refine changes' representations feature generation. CD-Lamba significantly enhances local-global spatio-temporal interactions in bi-temporal images, offering improved performance in RSCD tasks. Extensive experimental results show that CD-Lamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets with a satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/xwmaxwma/rschange.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15418v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration in sparse reward environments remains a significant challenge in reinforcement learning, particularly in Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs), where environments differ across episodes. Existing episodic intrinsic motivation methods for CMDPs primarily rely on count-based approaches, which are ineffective in large state spaces, or on similarity-based methods that lack appropriate metrics for state comparison. To address these shortcomings, we propose Episodic Novelty Through Temporal Distance (ETD), a novel approach that introduces temporal distance as a robust metric for state similarity and intrinsic reward computation. By employing contrastive learning, ETD accurately estimates temporal distances and derives intrinsic rewards based on the novelty of states within the current episode. Extensive experiments on various benchmark tasks demonstrate that ETD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing exploration in sparse reward CMDPs.</p></details> | ICLR2025 |

Current state-of-the-art approaches are based on supervised learning with a conditioned policy. However, these approaches fall short in real-world applications that involve complex tasks with rich temporal and logical structures. In this paper, we propose temporal logic Specification-conditioned Decision Transformer (SDT), a novel framework that harnesses the expressive power of signal temporal logic (STL) to specify complex temporal rules that an agent should follow and the sequential modeling capability of Decision Transformer (DT). Empirical evaluations on the DSRL benchmarks demonstrate the better capacity of SDT in learning safe and high-reward policies compared with existing approaches. In addition, SDT shows good alignment with respect to different desired degrees of satisfaction of the STL specification that it is conditioned on.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICML 2024</p></details> |

Traditionally, visual data has been the primary source for object perception; however, it often proves insufficient in scenarios where visibility is obstructed or detailed observation is needed. This gap highlights the necessity of tactile sensing as a complementary or primary input for material recognition. Tactile data becomes particularly essential in contact-rich, small-scale manipulations where subtle deformations and surface interactions cannot be accurately captured by vision alone. This letter presents a novel approach leveraging a temporal binding foundation model for tactile sequence understanding to enhance material property recognition. By processing tactile sensor data with a temporal focus, the proposed system captures the sequential nature of tactile interactions, similar to human fingertip perception. Additionally, this letter demonstrates that, through tailored and specific design, the foundation model can more effectively capture temporal information embedded in tactile sequences, advancing material property understanding. Experimental results validate the model's capability to capture these temporal patterns, confirming its utility for material property recognition in visually restricted scenarios. This work underscores the necessity of embedding advanced tactile data processing frameworks within robotic systems to achieve truly embodied and responsive manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | 4 pages, |

In performing segmentation, deep learning (DL) algorithms improved accuracy significantly compared to traditional image processing approaches. More recently, studies showed that enhancing DL segmentation with motion information can further improve it. A range of methods for injecting motion information has been proposed, but many of them increase the dimensionality of input images (which is computationally expensive) or have not used an optimal method to insert motion information, such as non-DL registration, non-attention-based networks or single-headed attention. Here, we present a novel, computation-efficient alternative where a novel, scalable temporal attention module (TAM) extracts temporal feature interactions multiple times and where TAM has a multi-headed, KQV projection cross-attention architecture. The module can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing CNN- or Transformer-based networks, providing novel flexibility for inclusion in future implementations. Extensive evaluations on different cardiac datasets, 2D echocardiography (CAMUS), and 3D echocardiography (MITEA) demonstrate the model's effectiveness when integrated into well-established backbone networks like UNet, FCN8s, UNetR, SwinUNetR, and the recent I2UNet. We further find that the optimized TAM-enhanced FCN8s network performs well compared to contemporary alternatives. Our results confirm TAM's robustness, scalability, and generalizability across diverse datasets and backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Late-Stage Contrast Enhancement in Breast MRI: A Comprehensive Pipeline Leveraging Temporal Contrast Enhancement Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01596v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis due to its ability to characterize tissue through contrast agent kinetics. However, traditional DCE-MRI protocols require multiple imaging phases, including early and late post-contrast acquisitions, leading to prolonged scan times, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, high costs, and limited accessibility. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a pipeline for synthesizing late-phase DCE-MRI images from early-phase data, replicating the time-intensity (TI) curve behavior in enhanced regions while maintaining visual fidelity across the entire image. The proposed approach introduces a novel loss function, Time Intensity Loss (TI-loss), leveraging the temporal behavior of contrast agents to guide the training of a generative model. Additionally, a new normalization strategy, TI-norm, preserves the contrast enhancement pattern across multiple image sequences at various timestamps, addressing limitations of conventional normalization methods. Two metrics are proposed to evaluate image quality: the Contrast Agent Pattern Score ($\mathcal{CP}_{s}$), which validates enhancement patterns in annotated regions, and the Average Difference in Enhancement ($\mathcal{ED}$), measuring differences between real and generated enhancements. Using a public DCE-MRI dataset with 1.5T and 3T scanners, the proposed method demonstrates accurate synthesis of late-phase images that outperform existing models in replicating the TI curve's behavior in regions of interest while preserving overall image quality. This advancement shows a potential to optimize DCE-MRI protocols by reducing scanning time without compromising diagnostic accuracy, and bringing generative models closer to practical implementation in clinical scenarios to enhance efficiency in breast cancer imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CEGRL-TKGR: A Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning Framework for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07911v2)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph reasoning (TKGR) is increasingly gaining attention for its ability to extrapolate new events from historical data, thereby enriching the inherently incomplete temporal knowledge graphs. Existing graph-based representation learning frameworks have made significant strides in developing evolving representations for both entities and relational embeddings. Despite these achievements, there's a notable tendency in these models to inadvertently learn biased data representations and mine spurious correlations, consequently failing to discern the causal relationships between events. This often leads to incorrect predictions based on these false correlations. To address this, we propose an innovative Causal Enhanced Graph Representation Learning framework for TKGR (named CEGRL-TKGR). This framework introduces causal structures in graph-based representation learning to unveil the essential causal relationships between events, ultimately enhancing the performance of the TKGR task. Specifically, we first disentangle the evolutionary representations of entities and relations in a temporal knowledge graph sequence into two distinct components, namely causal representations and confounding representations. Then, drawing on causal intervention theory, we advocate the utilization of causal representations for predictions, aiming to mitigate the effects of erroneous correlations caused by confounding features, thus achieving more robust and accurate predictions. Finally, extensive experimental results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model in the link prediction task.</p></details> |  |

Traditional statistical TPPs have a long-standing history, with numerous models proposed and successfully applied across diverse domains. In recent years, advances in deep learning have spurred the development of neural TPPs, enabling greater flexibility and expressiveness in capturing complex temporal dynamics. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has further sparked excitement, offering new possibilities for modeling and analyzing event sequences by leveraging their rich contextual understanding. This survey presents a comprehensive review of recent research on TPPs from three perspectives: Bayesian, deep learning, and LLM approaches. We begin with a review of the fundamental concepts of TPPs, followed by an in-depth discussion of model design and parameter estimation techniques in these three frameworks. We also revisit classic application areas of TPPs to highlight their practical relevance. Finally, we outline challenges and promising directions for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Data-driven Dynamic Temporal Correlation Modeling Framework for Renewable Energy Scenario Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14233v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renewable energy power is influenced by the atmospheric system, which exhibits nonlinear and time-varying features. To address this, a dynamic temporal correlation modeling framework is proposed for renewable energy scenario generation. A novel decoupled mapping path is employed for joint probability distribution modeling, formulating regression tasks for both marginal distributions and the correlation structure using proper scoring rules to ensure the rationality of the modeling process. The scenario generation process is divided into two stages. Firstly, the dynamic correlation network models temporal correlations based on a dynamic covariance matrix, capturing the time-varying features of renewable energy while enhancing the interpretability of the black-box model. Secondly, the implicit quantile network models the marginal quantile function in a nonparametric, continuous manner, enabling scenario generation through marginal inverse sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dynamic correlation quantile network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in quantifying uncertainty and capturing dynamic correlation for short-term renewable energy scenario generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal State-Space Modeling for fMRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13074v2)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

Visualizing these graphs is crucial as it allows one to quickly identify anomalies, trends, patterns, and other properties that facilitate better decision-making. In this context, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is essential for constructing and visually analyzing the layout. The choice of resolution is particularly important, especially when dealing with temporally sparse graphs. In such cases, changing the temporal resolution by grouping events (i.e., edges) from consecutive timestamps -- a technique known as timeslicing -- can aid in the analysis and reveal patterns that might not be discernible otherwise. However, selecting an appropriate temporal resolution is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose ZigzagNetVis, a methodology that suggests temporal resolutions potentially relevant for analyzing a given graph, i.e., resolutions that lead to substantial topological changes in the graph structure. ZigzagNetVis achieves this by leveraging zigzag persistent homology, a well-established technique from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). To improve visual graph analysis, ZigzagNetVis incorporates the colored barcode, a novel timeline-based visualization inspired by persistence barcodes commonly used in TDA. We also contribute with a web-based system prototype that implements suggestion methodology and visualization tools. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of ZigzagNetVis through a usage scenario, a user study with 27 participants, and a detailed quantitative evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This document contains the main article and supplementary material.

Formal language tools provide a robust and sound method to verify safety rules for such complex cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of formal verification languages like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to generate safe trajectories and optimal control inputs for autonomous vehicle navigation. We implement a symbolic path planning approach using LTL to generate a formally safe reference trajectory. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver is then used on this reference trajectory to solve for the control inputs while satisfying the state, control and safety constraints described by STL. We test our proposed solution on two environments and compare the results with popular path planning algorithms. In contrast to conventional path planning algorithms, our formally safe solution excels in handling complex specification scenarios while ensuring both safety and comparable computation times.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, Modelling Estimation and Controls Conference-2024</p></details> |
| **[Training-Free Zero-Shot Temporal Action Detection with Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13795v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing zero-shot temporal action detection (ZSTAD) methods predominantly use fully supervised or unsupervised strategies to recognize unseen activities. However, these training-based methods are prone to domain shifts and require high computational costs, which hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, unlike previous works, we propose a training-Free Zero-shot temporal Action Detection (FreeZAD) method, leveraging existing vision-language (ViL) models to directly classify and localize unseen activities within untrimmed videos without any additional fine-tuning or adaptation. We mitigate the need for explicit temporal modeling and reliance on pseudo-label quality by designing the LOGarithmic decay weighted Outer-Inner-Contrastive Score (LogOIC) and frequency-based Actionness Calibration. Furthermore, we introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy using Prototype-Centric Sampling (PCS) to expand FreeZAD, enabling ViL models to adapt more effectively for ZSTAD. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods while requiring only 1/13 of the runtime. When equipped with TTA, the enhanced method further narrows the gap with fully supervised methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formally Verified Neurosymbolic Trajectory Learning via Tensor-based Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13712v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel formalisation of tensor semantics for linear temporal logic on finite traces (LTLf), with formal proofs of correctness carried out in the theorem prover Isabelle/HOL. We demonstrate that this formalisation can be integrated into a neurosymbolic learning process by defining and verifying a differentiable loss function for the LTLf constraints, and automatically generating an implementation that integrates with PyTorch. We show that, by using this loss, the process learns to satisfy pre-specified logical constraints. Our approach offers a fully rigorous framework for constrained training, eliminating many of the inherent risks of ad-hoc, manual implementations of logical aspects directly in an "unsafe" programming language such as Python, while retaining efficiency in implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ME-CPT: Multi-Task Enhanced Cross-Temporal Point Transformer for Urban 3D Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14004v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The point clouds collected by the Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) system provide accurate 3D information of urban land covers. By utilizing multi-temporal ALS point clouds, semantic changes in urban area can be captured, demonstrating significant potential in urban planning, emergency management, and infrastructure maintenance. Existing 3D change detection methods struggle to efficiently extract multi-class semantic information and change features, still facing the following challenges: (1) the difficulty of accurately modeling cross-temporal point clouds spatial relationships for effective change feature extraction; (2) class imbalance of change samples which hinders distinguishability of semantic features; (3) the lack of real-world datasets for 3D semantic change detection. To resolve these challenges, we propose the Multi-task Enhanced Cross-temporal Point Transformer (ME-CPT) network. ME-CPT establishes spatiotemporal correspondences between point cloud across different epochs and employs attention mechanisms to jointly extract semantic change features, facilitating information exchange and change comparison. Additionally, we incorporate a semantic segmentation task and through the multi-task training strategy, further enhance the distinguishability of semantic features, reducing the impact of class imbalance in change types. Moreover, we release a 22.5 $km^2$ 3D semantic change detection dataset, offering diverse scenes for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on multiple datasets show that the proposed MT-CPT achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code and dataset will be released upon acceptance at \url{https://github.com/zhangluqi0209/ME-CPT}.</p></details> |  |
| **[BOPIM: Bayesian Optimization for influence maximization on temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04700v3)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of influence maximization (IM) is to select a small set of seed nodes which maximizes the spread of influence on a network. In this work, we propose BOPIM, a Bayesian Optimization (BO) algorithm for IM on temporal networks. The IM task is well-suited for a BO solution due to its expensive and complicated objective function. There are at least two key challenges, however, that must be overcome, primarily due to the inputs coming from a cardinality-constrained, non-Euclidean, combinatorial space. The first is constructing the kernel function for the Gaussian Process regression. We propose two kernels, one based on the Hamming distance between seed sets and the other leveraging the Jaccard coefficient between node's neighbors. The second challenge is the acquisition function. For this, we use the Expected Improvement function, suitably adjusting for noise in the observations, and optimize it using a greedy algorithm to account for the cardinality constraint. In numerical experiments on real-world networks, we prove that BOPIM outperforms competing methods and yields comparable influence spreads to a gold-standard greedy algorithm while being as much as ten times faster. In addition, we find that the Hamming kernel performs favorably compared to the Jaccard kernel in nearly all settings, a somewhat surprising result as the former does not explicitly account for the graph structure. Finally, we demonstrate two ways that the proposed method can quantify uncertainty in optimal seed sets. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to look at uncertainty in the seed sets for IM.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we introduce DiffVC, a diffusion-based perceptual neural video compression framework that effectively integrates foundational diffusion model with the video conditional coding paradigm. This framework uses temporal context from previously decoded frame and the reconstructed latent representation of the current frame to guide the diffusion model in generating high-quality results. To accelerate the iterative inference process of diffusion model, we propose the Temporal Diffusion Information Reuse (TDIR) strategy, which significantly enhances inference efficiency with minimal performance loss by reusing the diffusion information from previous frames. Additionally, to address the challenges posed by distortion differences across various bitrates, we propose the Quantization Parameter-based Prompting (QPP) mechanism, which utilizes quantization parameters as prompts fed into the foundational diffusion model to explicitly modulate intermediate features, thereby enabling a robust variable bitrate diffusion-based neural compression framework. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution delivers excellent performance in both perception metrics and visual quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages. The code is available at: https://github.com/Majy-Yuji/ST-USleepNet.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMoE: Heterogeneity-Informed Mixture-of-Experts for Fair Spatial-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00316v2)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving fair prediction performance across nodes is crucial in the spatial-temporal domain, as it ensures the validity and reliability of forecasting outcomes. However, existing models focus primarily on improving the overall accuracy of the prediction, often neglecting the goal of achieving uniformity in the predictions. This task becomes particularly challenging due to the inherent spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the nodes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-informed Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) for fair spatial-temporal forecasting. In particular, we design the Heterogeneity-Informed Graph Convolutional Network (HiGCN), which leverages the fusion of multi-graph and edge masking to flexibly model spatial dependencies. Moreover, we introduce the Node-wise Mixture-of-Experts (NMoE), which allocates prediction tasks of different nodes to suitable experts through graph decoupling routing. To further improve the model, fairness-aware loss and evaluation functions are proposed, optimizing the model with fairness and accuracy as objectives. Experiments on four datasets from different real-world scenarios demonstrate that HiMoE achieves the state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best baseline with at lease 9.22% in all metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Making Temporal Betweenness Computation Faster and Restless](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12708v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bu{\ss} et al [KDD 2020] recently proved that the problem of computing the betweenness of all nodes of a temporal graph is computationally hard in the case of foremost and fastest paths, while it is solvable in time O(n 3 T 2 ) in the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, where n is the number of nodes and T is the number of distinct time steps. A new algorithm for temporal betweenness computation is introduced in this paper. In the case of shortest and shortest foremost paths, it requires O(n + M ) space and runs in time where M is the number of temporal edges, thus significantly improving the algorithm of Bu{\ss} et al in terms of time complexity (note that T is usually large). Experimental evidence is provided that our algorithm performs between twice and almost 250 times better than the algorithm of Bu{\ss} et al. Moreover, we were able to compute the exact temporal betweenness values of several large temporal graphs with over a million of temporal edges. For such size, only approximate computation was possible by using the algorithm of Santoro and Sarpe [WWW 2022]. Maybe more importantly, our algorithm extends to the case of restless walks (that is, walks with waiting constraints in each node), thus providing a polynomial-time algorithm (with complexity O(nM )) for computing the temporal betweenness in the case of several different optimality criteria. Such restless computation was known only for the shortest criterion (Rymar et al [JGAA 2023]), with complexity O(n 2 M T 2 ). We performed an extensive experimental validation by comparing different waiting constraints and different optimisation criteria. Moreover, as a case study, we investigate six public transit networks including Berlin, Rome, and Paris. Overall we find a general consistency between the different variants of betweenness centrality. However, we do measure a sensible influence of waiting constraints, and note some cases of low correlation for certain pairs of criteria in some networks.</p></details> |  |

We derive non-asymptotic bounds that lead to convergence rates, addressing both temporal and spatial dependence in the observed measurements. By accounting for dependencies across time and space, our models better reflect the complexities of real-world data, enhancing both predictive performance and theoretical robustness. We also tackle the curse of dimensionality by modeling the data on a manifold, exploring the intrinsic dimensionality of high-dimensional data. We broaden existing theoretical findings of temporal-spatial analysis by applying them to neural networks in more general contexts and demonstrate that our proof techniques are effective for models with short-range dependence. Our empirical simulations across various synthetic response functions underscore the superior performance of our method, outperforming established approaches in the existing literature. These findings provide valuable insights into the strong capabilities of dense neural networks (Dense NN) for temporal-spatial modeling across a broad range of function classes.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, we propose a novel single-image deblurring approach that treats motion blur as a temporal averaging phenomenon. Our core innovation lies in leveraging a pre-trained video diffusion transformer model to capture diverse motion dynamics within a latent space. It sidesteps explicit kernel estimation and effectively accommodates diverse motion patterns. We implement the algorithm within a diffusion-based inverse problem framework. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in deblurring complex motion blur scenarios. This work paves the way for utilizing powerful video diffusion models to address single-image deblurring challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultralow-dimensionality reduction for identifying critical transitions by spatial-temporal PCA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12582v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each patient.</p></details> |  |

Edge robot systems such as small drones need to execute complex maneuvers at high-speeds with limited resources, which places strict constraints on the underlying algorithms and hardware. Traditionally, frame-based cameras are used for vision-based perception due to their rich spatial information and simplified synchronous sensing capabilities. However, obtaining detailed information across frames incurs high energy consumption and may not even be required. In addition, their low temporal resolution renders them ineffective in high-speed motion scenarios. Event-based cameras offer a biologically-inspired solution to this by capturing only changes in intensity levels at exceptionally high temporal resolution and low power consumption, making them ideal for high-speed motion scenarios. However, their asynchronous and sparse outputs are not natively suitable with conventional deep learning methods. In this work, we propose TOFFE, a lightweight hybrid framework for performing event-based object motion estimation (including pose, direction, and speed estimation), referred to as Object Flow. TOFFE integrates bio-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and conventional Analog Neural Networks (ANNs), to efficiently process events at high temporal resolutions while being simple to train. Additionally, we present a novel event-based synthetic dataset involving high-speed object motion to train TOFFE. Our experimental results show that TOFFE achieves 5.7x/8.3x reduction in energy consumption and 4.6x/5.8x reduction in latency on edge GPU(Jetson TX2)/hybrid hardware(Loihi-2 and Jetson TX2), compared to previous event-based object detection baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Memory Storyboard: Leveraging Temporal Segmentation for Streaming Self-Supervised Learning from Egocentric Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12254v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning holds the promise to learn good representations from real-world continuous uncurated data streams. However, most existing works in visual self-supervised learning focus on static images or artificial data streams. Towards exploring a more realistic learning substrate, we investigate streaming self-supervised learning from long-form real-world egocentric video streams. Inspired by the event segmentation mechanism in human perception and memory, we propose "Memory Storyboard" that groups recent past frames into temporal segments for more effective summarization of the past visual streams for memory replay. To accommodate efficient temporal segmentation, we propose a two-tier memory hierarchy: the recent past is stored in a short-term memory, and the storyboard temporal segments are then transferred to a long-term memory. Experiments on real-world egocentric video datasets including SAYCam and KrishnaCam show that contrastive learning objectives on top of storyboard frames result in semantically meaningful representations which outperform those produced by state-of-the-art unsupervised continual learning methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Exploring Temporally-Aware Features for Point Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12218v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point tracking in videos is a fundamental task with applications in robotics, video editing, and more. While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information. In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

| **[Community Discovery Algorithm Based on Spatio-temporal Graph Embedding in Dynamic Social Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12208v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Community discovery is one of the key issues in the study of dynamic social networks. Traditional community discovery algorithms only focus on the establishment and disconnection of connections between nodes, failing to capture deeper factors. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a community discovery algorithm based on spatiotemporal graph embedding (CDA-SGE), which integrates spatial information and evolutions of nodes to comprehensively capture the dynamic features of networks. Specifically, this algorithm employs Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) to aggregate latent spatial information, effectively representing the embedding of nodes in space. Temporal evolutions of the nodes are then modeled using Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), thereby solving problems such as node dynamism and relationship transmission. Finally, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied to cluster dynamic network representations and identify community affiliations of nodes. We then perform simulations on four types of dynamic networks and show that the CDA-SGE outperforms traditional community discovery algorithms in terms of purity, standardized mutual information, heterogeneity, and homogeneity. These results demonstrate the algorithm's superior ability to accurately uncover community structures hidden in dynamic social networks.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities, generating significant research interest in their application for reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Existing LLM-based methods have integrated retrieved historical facts or static graph representations into LLMs. Despite the notable performance of LLM-based methods, they are limited by the insufficient modeling of temporal patterns and ineffective cross-modal alignment between graph and language, hindering the ability of LLMs to fully grasp the temporal and structural information in TKGs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework TGL-LLM to integrate temporal graph learning into LLM-based temporal knowledge graph model. Specifically, we introduce temporal graph learning to capture the temporal and relational patterns and obtain the historical graph embedding. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph tokenization to sufficiently model the temporal patterns within LLMs. To achieve better alignment between graph and language, we employ a two-stage training paradigm to finetune LLMs on high-quality and diverse data, thereby resulting in better performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Spatial-Temporal Triangulation for Bearing-Only Cooperative Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15846v4)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based cooperative motion estimation is an important problem for many multi-robot systems such as cooperative aerial target pursuit. This problem can be formulated as bearing-only cooperative motion estimation, where the visual measurement is modeled as a bearing vector pointing from the camera to the target. The conventional approaches for bearing-only cooperative estimation are mainly based on the framework distributed Kalman filtering (DKF). In this paper, we propose a new optimal bearing-only cooperative estimation algorithm, named spatial-temporal triangulation, based on the method of distributed recursive least squares, which provides a more flexible framework for designing distributed estimators than DKF. The design of the algorithm fully incorporates all the available information and the specific triangulation geometric constraint. As a result, the algorithm has superior estimation performance than the state-of-the-art DKF algorithms in terms of both accuracy and convergence speed as verified by numerical simulation. We rigorously prove the exponential convergence of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under practical challenging conditions, we develop a vision-based cooperative aerial target pursuit system, which is the first of such fully autonomous systems so far to the best of our knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community-Aware Temporal Walks: Parameter-Free Representation Learning on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11880v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning plays a crucial role in understanding evolving behaviors. However, existing methods often struggle with flexibility, adaptability, and the preservation of temporal and structural dynamics. To address these issues, we propose Community-aware Temporal Walks (CTWalks), a novel framework for representation learning on continuous-time dynamic graphs. CTWalks integrates three key components: a community-based parameter-free temporal walk sampling mechanism, an anonymization strategy enriched with community labels, and an encoding process that leverages continuous temporal dynamics modeled via ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This design enables precise modeling of both intra- and inter-community interactions, offering a fine-grained representation of evolving temporal patterns in continuous-time dynamic graphs. CTWalks theoretically overcomes locality bias in walks and establishes its connection to matrix factorization. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CTWalks outperforms established methods in temporal link prediction tasks, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simple, Strict, Proper, and Directed: Comparing Reachability in Directed and Undirected Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11697v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first comprehensive analysis of temporal settings for directed temporal graphs, fully resolving their hierarchy with respect to support, reachability, and induced-reachability equivalence. These notions, introduced by Casteigts, Corsini, and Sarkar, capture different levels of equivalence between temporal graph classes. Their analysis focused on undirected graphs under three dimensions: strict vs. non-strict (whether times along paths strictly increase), proper vs. arbitrary (whether adjacent edges can appear simultaneously), and simple vs. multi-labeled (whether an edge can appear multiple times). In this work, we extend their framework by adding the fundamental distinction of directed vs. undirected. Our results reveal a single-strand hierarchy for directed graphs, with strict & simple being the most expressive class and proper & simple the least expressive. In contrast, undirected graphs form a two-strand hierarchy, with strict & multi-labeled being the most expressive and proper & simple the least expressive. The two strands are formed by the non-strict & simple and the strict & simple class, which we show to be incomparable. In addition to examining the internal hierarchies of directed and of undirected graph classes, we compare the two. We show that each undirected class can be transformed into its directed counterpart under reachability equivalence, while no directed class can be transformed into any undirected one. Our findings have significant implications for the study of computational problems on temporal graphs. Positive results in more expressive graph classes extend to weaker classes as long as the problem is independent under reachability equivalence. Conversely, hardness results for a less expressive class propagate to stronger classes. We hope these findings will inspire a unified approach for analyzing temporal graphs under the different settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zep: A Temporal Knowledge Graph Architecture for Agent Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13956v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Zep, a novel memory layer service for AI agents that outperforms the current state-of-the-art system, MemGPT, in the Deep Memory Retrieval (DMR) benchmark. Additionally, Zep excels in more comprehensive and challenging evaluations than DMR that better reflect real-world enterprise use cases. While existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks for large language model (LLM)-based agents are limited to static document retrieval, enterprise applications demand dynamic knowledge integration from diverse sources including ongoing conversations and business data. Zep addresses this fundamental limitation through its core component Graphiti -- a temporally-aware knowledge graph engine that dynamically synthesizes both unstructured conversational data and structured business data while maintaining historical relationships. In the DMR benchmark, which the MemGPT team established as their primary evaluation metric, Zep demonstrates superior performance (94.8% vs 93.4%). Beyond DMR, Zep's capabilities are further validated through the more challenging LongMemEval benchmark, which better reflects enterprise use cases through complex temporal reasoning tasks. In this evaluation, Zep achieves substantial results with accuracy improvements of up to 18.5% while simultaneously reducing response latency by 90% compared to baseline implementations. These results are particularly pronounced in enterprise-critical tasks such as cross-session information synthesis and long-term context maintenance, demonstrating Zep's effectiveness for deployment in real-world applications.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 tables |
| **[On The Complexity of Maximizing Temporal Reachability via Trip Temporalisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08328v2)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of assigning appearing times to the edges of a digraph in order to maximize the (average) temporal reachability between pairs of nodes. Motivated by the application to public transit networks, where edges cannot be scheduled independently one of another, we consider the setting where the edges are grouped into certain walks (called trips) in the digraph and where assigning the appearing time to the first edge of a trip forces the appearing times of the subsequent edges. In this setting, we show that, quite surprisingly, it is NP-complete to decide whether there exists an assignment of times connecting a given pair of nodes. This result allows us to prove that the problem of maximising the temporal reachability cannot be approximated within a factor better than some polynomial term in the size of the graph. We thus focus on the case where, for each pair of nodes, there exists an assignment of times such that one node is reachable from the other. We call this property strong temporalisability. It is a very natural assumption for the application to public transit networks. On the negative side, the problem of maximising the temporal reachability remains hard to approximate within a factor $\sqrt$ n/12 in that setting. Moreover, we show the existence of collections of trips that are strongly temporalisable but for which any assignment of starting times to the trips connects at most an O(1/ $\sqrt$ n) fraction of all pairs of nodes. On the positive side, we show that there must exist an assignment of times that connects a constant fraction of all pairs in the strongly temporalisable and symmetric case, that is, when the set of trips to be scheduled is such that, for each trip, there is a symmetric trip visiting the same nodes in reverse order.

| **[On the Complexity of Computing a Fastest Temporal Path in Interval Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11380v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They usually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance, duration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific points in time, while in the more general interval model, edges can be present over multiple time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge can change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are equivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is equivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However, this transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has complexity issues. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to the complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path from a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be traversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from source to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the point model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time under classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear time, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the best known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges. Interestingly, we show that near-linear time is possible in the interval model when restricted to all delays being zero, i.e. traversing an edge is instantaneous.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve high-quality results across image and video try-on tasks, especially in long video scenarios. In this work, we introduce CatV2TON, a simple and effective vision-based virtual try-on (V2TON) method that supports both image and video try-on tasks with a single diffusion transformer model. By temporally concatenating garment and person inputs and training on a mix of image and video datasets, CatV2TON achieves robust try-on performance across static and dynamic settings. For efficient long-video generation, we propose an overlapping clip-based inference strategy that uses sequential frame guidance and Adaptive Clip Normalization (AdaCN) to maintain temporal consistency with reduced resource demands. We also present ViViD-S, a refined video try-on dataset, achieved by filtering back-facing frames and applying 3D mask smoothing for enhanced temporal consistency. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CatV2TON outperforms existing methods in both image and video try-on tasks, offering a versatile and reliable solution for realistic virtual try-ons across diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, it incurs significant computation overheads due to its iterative structure. To address these overheads, we analyze this iterative structure and observe that adjacent time steps in diffusion models exhibit high value similarity, leading to narrower differences between consecutive time steps. We adapt these characteristics to a quantized diffusion model and reveal that the majority of these differences can be represented with reduced bit-width, and even zero. Based on our observations, we propose the Ditto algorithm, a difference processing algorithm that leverages temporal similarity with quantization to enhance the efficiency of diffusion models. By exploiting the narrower differences and the distributive property of layer operations, it performs full bit-width operations for the initial time step and processes subsequent steps with temporal differences. In addition, Ditto execution flow optimization is designed to mitigate the memory overhead of temporal difference processing, further boosting the efficiency of the Ditto algorithm. We also design the Ditto hardware, a specialized hardware accelerator, fully exploiting the dynamic characteristics of the proposed algorithm. As a result, the Ditto hardware achieves up to 1.5x speedup and 17.74% energy saving compared to other accelerators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA 2025)</p></details> |

Our characterization of the resource utilization of virtual machines (VMs) in Azure reveals that, while CPU is the main underutilized resource, we need to provide a solution to manage all resources holistically. We also observe that many VMs exhibit complementary temporal patterns, which can be leveraged to improve the oversubscription of underutilized resources. Based on these insights, we propose Coach: a system that exploits temporal patterns for all-resource oversubscription in cloud platforms. Coach uses long-term predictions and an efficient VM scheduling policy to exploit temporally complementary patterns. We introduce a new general-purpose VM type, called CoachVM, where we partition each resource allocation into a guaranteed and an oversubscribed portion. Coach monitors the oversubscribed resources to detect contention and mitigate any potential performance degradation. We focus on memory management, which is particularly challenging due to memory's sensitivity to contention and the overhead required to reassign it between CoachVMs. Our experiments show that Coach enables platforms to host up to ~26% more VMs with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2 (ASPLOS'25). 15 pages</p></details> |

The META AI Challenge on video copy detection provided a benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art methods, with the Dual-level detection approach emerging as a winning solution. This method integrates Video Editing Detection and Frame Scene Detection to handle adversarial transformations and large datasets efficiently. However, our analysis reveals significant limitations in the VED component, particularly in its ability to handle exact copies. Moreover, Dual-level detection shows vulnerability to temporal attacks.

Our method achieves an increase of 1.4 to 5.8 times in efficiency over the standard 1 FPS approach. Compared to Dual-level detection method, our approach maintains comparable micro-average precision ($\mu$AP) while also demonstrating improved robustness against temporal attacks.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Existing works directly utilize weakly-supervised base model to generate instance-level pseudo-labels for training the fully-supervised detection head. We argue that the noise in pseudo-labels would interfere with the learning of fully-supervised detection head, leading to significant performance leakage. Issues with noisy labels include:(1) inaccurate boundary localization; (2) undetected short action clips; (3) multiple adjacent segments incorrectly detected as one segment. To target these issues, we introduce a two-stage noisy label learning strategy to harness every potential useful signal in noisy labels. First, we propose a frame-level pseudo-label generation model with a context-aware denoising algorithm to refine the boundaries. Second, we introduce an online-revised teacher-student framework with a missing instance compensation module and an ambiguous instance correction module to solve the short-action-missing and many-to-one problems. Besides, we apply a high-quality pseudo-label mining loss in our online-revised teacher-student framework to add different weights to the noisy labels to train more effectively. Our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method in detection accuracy and inference speed greatly upon the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.2 benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While prior methods employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous encoding, they often struggle to capture the complexity of video data, relying on simple coordinate concatenation and pre-trained optical flow network for motion representation. Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve-and even degrade performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art PSNR and SSIM performance, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.</p></details> | 11pages, 5 figures |

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often fail to effectively integrate temporal information and perform efficient cross-modal interactions, which constrain their adaptability to dynamic targets. In this paper, we propose BTMTrack, a novel framework for RGB-T tracking. The core of our approach lies in the dual-template backbone network and the Temporal-Modal Candidate Elimination (TMCE) strategy. The dual-template backbone effectively integrates temporal information, while the TMCE strategy focuses the model on target-relevant tokens by evaluating temporal and modal correlations, reducing computational overhead and avoiding irrelevant background noise. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Temporal Dual Template Bridging (TDTB) module, which facilitates precise cross-modal fusion through dynamically filtered tokens. This approach further strengthens the interaction between templates and the search region. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BTMTrack. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 72.3% precision rate on the LasHeR test set and competitive results on RGBT210 and RGBT234 datasets.</p></details> |  |

The answer is No!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10674v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant advancements in tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA) by leveraging foundational Large Language Models (LLMs). However, their abilities in specific areas such as temporal understanding, which is crucial for comprehending real-world dynamics, remain underexplored. To address this, we propose a challenging evaluation benchmark named TemporalVQA, consisting of two parts: (1) Temporal Order Understanding and (2) Time-lapse Estimation. The first part requires MLLMs to determine the sequence of events by analyzing temporally consecutive video frames. The second part presents image pairs with varying time differences, framed as multiple-choice questions, asking MLLMs to estimate the time-lapse between images with options ranging from seconds to years. Our evaluations of advanced MLLMs, including models like GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro, reveal significant challenges: GPT-4o achieved only 43.8% average consistent accuracy in temporal order tasks and 70% in time-lapse estimation, with open-source models performing even less effectively. These findings underscore the limitations of current MLLMs in visual temporal understanding and reasoning, highlighting the need for further improvements in their temporal capabilities.

However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present adversarial attacks designed specifically for MTPP models. A key criterion for a good adversarial attack is its imperceptibility. For objects such as images or text, this is often achieved by bounding perturbation in some fixed $L_p$ norm-ball. However, similarly minimizing distance norms between two CTESs in the context of MTPPs is challenging due to their sequential nature and varying time-scales and lengths. We address this challenge by first permuting the events and then incorporating the additive noise to the arrival timestamps. However, the worst case optimization of such adversarial attacks is a hard combinatorial problem, requiring exploration across a permutation space that is factorially large in the length of the input sequence. As a result, we propose a novel differentiable scheme PERMTPP using which we can perform adversarial attacks by learning to minimize the likelihood, while minimizing the distance between two CTESs. Our experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the offensive and defensive capabilities, and lower inference times of PERMTPP.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025 (Main Track)</p></details> |

However, the prevalence of missing data in real-world sensor networks significantly complicates this task. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Graph MLP-Mixer (T-GMM), a novel architecture designed to address these challenges. The model combines node-level processing with patch-level subgraph encoding to capture localized spatial dependencies while leveraging a three-dimensional MLP-Mixer to handle temporal, spatial, and feature-based dependencies. Experiments on the AQI, ENGRAD, PV-US and METR-LA datasets demonstrate the model's ability to effectively forecast even in the presence of significant missing data. While not surpassing state-of-the-art models in all scenarios, the T-GMM exhibits strong learning capabilities, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies. These results highlight its potential for robust, scalable spatiotemporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPCL-Diff: The Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning Based on Graph Node Diffusion Model with Dual-Domain Periodic Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01477v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning that infers future missing facts is an essential and challenging task. Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Graph Learning on Adaptive Mined Key Frames for High-performance Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10129v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of multi-object tracking, the challenge of accurately capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between objects in video sequences remains a significant hurdle. This is further complicated by frequent occurrences of mutual occlusions among objects, which can lead to tracking errors and reduced performance in existing methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose a novel adaptive key frame mining strategy that addresses the limitations of current tracking approaches. Specifically, we introduce a Key Frame Extraction (KFE) module that leverages reinforcement learning to adaptively segment videos, thereby guiding the tracker to exploit the intrinsic logic of the video content. This approach allows us to capture structured spatial relationships between different objects as well as the temporal relationships of objects across frames. To tackle the issue of object occlusions, we have developed an Intra-Frame Feature Fusion (IFF) module. Unlike traditional graph-based methods that primarily focus on inter-frame feature fusion, our IFF module uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to facilitate information exchange between the target and surrounding objects within a frame. This innovation significantly enhances target distinguishability and mitigates tracking loss and appearance similarity due to occlusions. By combining the strengths of both long and short trajectories and considering the spatial relationships between objects, our proposed tracker achieves impressive results on the MOT17 dataset, i.e., 68.6 HOTA, 81.0 IDF1, 66.6 AssA, and 893 IDS, proving its effectiveness and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series (SITS). Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution SITS acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |

This task poses a significant challenge of managing temporal heterogeneity while at the same time maintaining stable face attributes. In this paper, we introduce a Discrete Prior-based Temporal-Coherent content prediction transformer to address the challenge, and our model is referred to as DP-TempCoh. Specifically, we incorporate a spatial-temporal-aware content prediction module to synthesize high-quality content from discrete visual priors, conditioned on degraded video tokens. To further enhance the temporal coherence of the predicted content, a motion statistics modulation module is designed to adjust the content, based on discrete motion priors in terms of cross-frame mean and variance. As a result, the statistics of the predicted content can match with that of real videos over time. By performing extensive experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the design elements and demonstrate the superior performance of our DP-TempCoh in both synthetically and naturally degraded video restoration.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaNeRV: Meta Neural Representations for Videos with Spatial-Temporal Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02427v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Representations for Videos (NeRV) has emerged as a promising implicit neural representation (INR) approach for video analysis, which represents videos as neural networks with frame indexes as inputs. However, NeRV-based methods are time-consuming when adapting to a large number of diverse videos, as each video requires a separate NeRV model to be trained from scratch. In addition, NeRV-based methods spatially require generating a high-dimension signal (i.e., an entire image) from the input of a low-dimension timestamp, and a video typically consists of tens of frames temporally that have a minor change between adjacent frames. To improve the efficiency of video representation, we propose Meta Neural Representations for Videos, named MetaNeRV, a novel framework for fast NeRV representation for unseen videos. MetaNeRV leverages a meta-learning framework to learn an optimal parameter initialization, which serves as a good starting point for adapting to new videos. To address the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of video modality, we further introduce spatial-temporal guidance to improve the representation capabilities of MetaNeRV. Specifically, the spatial guidance with a multi-resolution loss aims to capture the information from different resolution stages, and the temporal guidance with an effective progressive learning strategy could gradually refine the number of fitted frames during the meta-learning process. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate the superiority of MetaNeRV for video representations and video compression.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

This enables us to design an algorithm to sample synthetic networks that preserves the $d$-hop neighborhood structure of a given temporal network. The higher $d$ is chosen, the better the temporal neighborhood structure of the original network is preserved. Specifically, we provide efficient algorithms that preserve time-respecting ("causal") paths in the networks up to length $d$, and scale to real-world network sizes. We validate our approach theoretically (for Degree and Katz centrality) and experimentally (for edge persistence, causal triangles, and burstiness). An experimental comparison shows that our method retains these key temporal characteristics more effectively than existing randomization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerability-Aware Spatio-Temporal Learning for Generalizable and Interpretable Deepfake Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01184v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging due to the complex intertwined spatial and temporal artifacts in forged sequences. Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

While static network models can capture unchanging topological regularities, they often fail to model the effects associated with the causal generative process of the network that occurs in time. Hence, exploiting the temporal aspect of networks has been the focus of many recent studies. In this context, we propose a new framework for generative models of continuous-time temporal networks. We assume that the activation of the edges in a temporal network is driven by a specified temporal point process. This approach allows to directly model the waiting time between events while incorporating time-varying history-based features as covariates in the predictions. Coupled with a thinning algorithm designed for the simulation of point processes, SimHawNet enables simulation of the evolution of temporal networks in continuous time. Finally, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess the performance of such an approach, in which we demonstrate that SimHawNet successfully simulates the evolution of networks with very different generative processes and achieves performance comparable to the state of the art, while being significantly faster.</p></details> |  |

Methods: The dDiMo framework integrates temporal information from time-resolved dimensions, allowing for the concurrent capture of intra-frame spatial features and inter-frame temporal dynamics in diffusion modeling. It employs additional spatiotemporal ($x$-$t$) and self-consistent frequency-temporal ($k$-$t$) priors to guide the diffusion process. This approach ensures precise temporal alignment and enhances the recovery of fine image details. To facilitate a smooth diffusion process, the nonlinear conjugate gradient algorithm is utilized during the reverse diffusion steps. The proposed model was tested on two types of MRI data: Cartesian-acquired multi-coil cardiac MRI and Golden-Angle-Radial-acquired multi-coil free-breathing lung MRI, across various undersampling rates. Results: dDiMo achieved high-quality reconstructions at various acceleration factors, demonstrating improved temporal alignment and structural recovery compared to other competitive reconstruction methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This proposed diffusion framework exhibited robust performance in handling both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions, effectively reconstructing dynamic datasets in cardiac and lung MRI under different imaging conditions.

Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final camera-ready version published at NeurIPS 2024.

One core task in DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$. Distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, which extends the classic temporal difference learning (TD) in RL. In this paper, we focus on the non-asymptotic statistical rates of distributional TD. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose non-parametric distributional TD (NTD). For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, we show that for NTD with a generative model, we need $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\mu_{\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-3})$ interactions with the environment to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $1$-Wasserstein. This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. In addition, we revisit categorical distributional TD (CTD), showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance. We also extend our analysis to the more general setting where the data generating process is Markovian. In the Markovian setting, we propose variance-reduced variants of NTD and CTD, and show that both can achieve a $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2} \mu_{\pi,\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-3}+t_{mix}\mu_{\pi,\min}^{-1}(1-\gamma)^{-1})$ sample complexity bounds in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance, which matches the state-of-the-art statistical results for classic policy evaluation. To achieve the sharp statistical rates, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces. This new Freedman's inequality would be of independent interest for statistical analysis of various infinite-dimensional online learning problems.</p></details> |  |

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, apparent trade-offs between acquisition time, image noise, and resolution limit clinical applicability. In particular, in regions of highly transient flow, coarse temporal resolution can hinder accurate capture of physiologically relevant flow variations. To overcome these issues, post-processing techniques using deep learning have shown promising results to enhance resolution post-scan using so-called super-resolution networks. However, while super-resolution has been focusing on spatial upsampling, temporal super-resolution remains largely unexplored. The aim of this study was therefore to implement and evaluate a residual network for temporal super-resolution 4D Flow MRI. To achieve this, an existing spatial network (4DFlowNet) was re-designed for temporal upsampling, adapting input dimensions, and optimizing internal layer structures. Training and testing were performed using synthetic 4D Flow MRI data originating from patient-specific in-silico models, as well as using in-vivo datasets. Overall, excellent performance was achieved with input velocities effectively denoised and temporally upsampled, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.0 cm/s in an unseen in-silico setting, outperforming deterministic alternatives (linear interpolation MAE = 2.3 cm/s, sinc interpolation MAE = 2.6 cm/s). Further, the network synthesized high-resolution temporal information from unseen low-resolution in-vivo data, with strong correlation observed at peak flow frames. As such, our results highlight the potential of utilizing data-driven neural networks for temporal super-resolution 4D Flow MRI, enabling high-frame-rate flow quantification without extending acquisition times beyond clinically acceptable limits.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models.

Our path planner replans for robots by utilizing a hierarchical approach, dividing the workspace, and computing collision-free paths for robots within each cell in parallel. Distributed trajectory optimization generates a deadlock-free trajectory for efficient execution and maintains the control feasibility even when the optimization fails. Our hierarchical approach combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized methods, achieving a high task success rate while providing real-time replanning capability. Compared to decentralized approaches, our approach effectively avoids deadlocks and collisions, significantly increasing the task success rate.

| **[Toward Safe Integration of UAM in Terminal Airspace: UAM Route Feasibility Assessment using Probabilistic Aircraft Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16599v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Urban Air Mobility (UAM) into airspace managed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) poses significant challenges, particularly in congested terminal environments. This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset. Moreover, using a successive Galerkin approximation method, we provide an algorithmic recipe how to construct the corresponding optimal learning trajectories leading to the optimal estimated model parameters for such a class of learning problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages (A further extension of the paper: arXiv:2412.08772)</p></details> |

We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |

| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Generation of Near-Minimum-Energy Trajectories via Constraint-Informed Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09450v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotics demands significant energy to operate, making energy-reduction methodologies increasingly important. Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories in scenarios where measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets.

| **[Predicting 4D Hand Trajectory from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08329v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HaPTIC, an approach that infers coherent 4D hand trajectories from monocular videos. Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

While promising approaches exist, they often revolve around pedestrian datasets excluding traffic-related information, or resemble architectures that are either not real-time capable or robust. To address these limitations, we first introduce a dedicated benchmark based on Argoverse 2, specifically targeting pedestrians in traffic environments. Following this, we present Snapshot, a modular, feed-forward neural network that outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the Average Displacement Error (ADE) by 8.8% while utilizing significantly less information. Despite its agent-centric encoding scheme, Snapshot demonstrates scalability, real-time performance, and robustness to varying motion histories. Moreover, by integrating Snapshot into a modular autonomous driving software stack, we showcase its real-world applicability.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Pitch Plane Trajectory Tracking Control for Sounding Rockets via Adaptive Feedback Linearization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05285v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a pitch plane trajectory tacking control solution for suborbital launch vehicles relying on adaptive feedback linearization. Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

It is often due to limitations like complex architectures customized for a specific dataset and inefficient multimodal handling. We propose Perceiver with Register queries (PerReg+), a novel trajectory prediction framework that introduces: (1) Dual-Level Representation Learning via Self-Distillation (SD) and Masked Reconstruction (MR), capturing global context and fine-grained details. Additionally, our approach of reconstructing segmentlevel trajectories and lane segments from masked inputs with query drop, enables effective use of contextual information and improves generalization; (2) Enhanced Multimodality using register-based queries and pretraining, eliminating the need for clustering and suppression; and (3) Adaptive Prompt Tuning during fine-tuning, freezing the main architecture and optimizing a small number of prompts for efficient adaptation. PerReg+ sets a new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes [1], Argoverse 2 [2], and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) [3]. Remarkable, our pretrained model reduces the error by 6.8% on smaller datasets, and multi-dataset training enhances generalization. In cross-domain tests, PerReg+ reduces B-FDE by 11.8% compared to its non-pretrained variant.</p></details> |  |

While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

In this task, the model is required to make predictions based on natural language instructions, egocentric view images before manipulation, and the given end-effector trajectories. Conventional methods typically perform success prediction only after the manipulation is executed, limiting their efficiency in executing the entire task sequence. We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately. We constructed a dataset based on the RT-1 dataset, a large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks, to evaluate our method.

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively.

Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions.

| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.</p></details> | Sensors 2020 |
| **[Enhancing Large Vision Model in Street Scene Semantic Understanding through Leveraging Posterior Optimization Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01710v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Multi-Agent Framework with Trajectory Learning for Knowledge-Intensive Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09893v3)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in various natural language processing tasks. However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00915v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIAA ...</summary><p>AIAA SCITECH 2025 Forum</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Temporal Attention based Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction for Internet of Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00890v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting vehicle behavior within complex traffic environments is pivotal within Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |

As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |

However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

Distributed trajectory optimization generates a deadlock-free trajectory for efficient execution and maintains the control feasibility even when the optimization fails. Our hierarchical approach combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized methods, achieving a high task success rate while providing real-time replanning capability. Compared to decentralized approaches, our approach effectively avoids deadlocks and collisions, significantly increasing the task success rate.

This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.13431</p></details> |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05585v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future multi-spacecraft missions require robust autonomous trajectory optimization capabilities to ensure safe and efficient rendezvous operations. This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10636v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

| **[STPOTR: Simultaneous Human Trajectory and Pose Prediction Using a Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Robot Following Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07600v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a neural network model to predict future human motion from an observed human motion history. We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Generation of Near-Minimum-Energy Trajectories via Constraint-Informed Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09450v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotics demands significant energy to operate, making energy-reduction methodologies increasingly important. Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories in scenarios where measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MGF: Mixed Gaussian Flow for Diverse Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12238v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To predict future trajectories, the normalizing flow with a standard Gaussian prior suffers from weak diversity. The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF). It achieves state-of-the-art performance in the evaluation of both trajectory alignment and diversity on the popular UCY/ETH and SDD datasets.

| **[Predicting 4D Hand Trajectory from Monocular Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08329v1)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HaPTIC, an approach that infers coherent 4D hand trajectories from monocular videos. Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction Based on Social Interactions Learning With Random Weights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07711v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical technology in the evolution of self-driving cars toward complete artificial intelligence. Over recent years, focusing on the trajectories of pedestrians to model their social interactions has surged with great interest in more accurate trajectory predictions. However, existing methods for modeling pedestrian social interactions rely on pre-defined rules, struggling to capture non-explicit social interactions. In this work, we propose a novel framework named DTGAN, which extends the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to graph sequence data, with the primary objective of automatically capturing implicit social interactions and achieving precise predictions of pedestrian trajectory. DTGAN innovatively incorporates random weights within each graph to eliminate the need for pre-defined interaction rules. We further enhance the performance of DTGAN by exploring diverse task loss functions during adversarial training, which yields improvements of 16.7\% and 39.3\% on metrics ADE and FDE, respectively. The effectiveness and accuracy of our framework are verified on two public datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed DTGAN achieves superior performance and is well able to understand pedestrians' intentions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,7 figures,Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM)</p></details> |
| **[Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07498v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07005v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10941v2)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, to be published in IEEE Sustech 2025</p></details> |

Initially, the 2D dynamics and kinematics for a single-engine, thrust-vector-controlled sounding rocket are obtained for control design purposes. Then, an inner-outer control strategy, which simultaneously tackles attitude and position control, is adopted, with the inner-loop comprising the altitude and pitch control and the outer-loop addressing the horizontal (downrange) position control. Feedback linearization is used to cancel out the non-linearities in both the inner and outer dynamics. Making use of Lyapunov stability theory, an adaptation law, which provides online estimates on the inner-loop aerodynamic uncertainty, is jointly designed with the output tracking controller via adaptive backstepping, ensuring global reference tracking in the region where the feedback linearization is well-defined. The zero dynamics of the inner-stabilized system are then exploited to obtain the outerloop dynamics and derive a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) with integral action, which can stabilize them as well as reject external disturbances. In the outermost loop, the estimate on the correspondent aerodynamic uncertainty is indirectly obtained by using the inner loop estimates together with known aerodynamics relations. The resulting inner-outer position control solution is proven to be asymptotically stable in the region of interest. Using a single-stage sounding rocket, propelled by a liquid engine, as reference vehicle, different mission scenarios are tested in a simulation environment to verify the adaptability of the proposed control strategy. The system is able to track the requested trajectories while rejecting external wind disturbances. Furthermore, the need to re-tune the control gains in between different mission scenarios is minimal to none.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025.

While recent methods based on the motion manifold hypothesis, which assumes that a set of trajectories lies on a lower-dimensional nonlinear subspace, address challenges such as limited dataset size and the high dimensionality of trajectory data, they often struggle to capture complex task-motion dependencies, i.e., when motion distributions shift drastically with task variations. To address this, we introduce Motion Manifold Flow Primitives (MMFP), a framework that decouples the training of the motion manifold from task-conditioned distributions. Specifically, we employ flow matching models, state-of-the-art conditional deep generative models, to learn task-conditioned distributions in the latent coordinate space of the learned motion manifold. Experiments are conducted on language-guided trajectory generation tasks, where many-to-many text-motion correspondences introduce complex task-motion dependencies, highlighting MMFP's superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pages, 11 figures |

We propose a novel approach that enables the prediction of success or failure by aligning the given trajectories and images with natural language instructions. We introduce Trajectory Encoder to apply learnable weighting to the input trajectories, allowing the model to consider temporal dynamics and interactions between objects and the end effector, improving the model's ability to predict manipulation outcomes accurately.

This paper presents two novel trajectory-prediction methods based on real-time position measurements and adaptive input and state estimation (AISE). The first method, called AISE/va, uses position measurements to estimate the target velocity and acceleration. The second method, called AISE/FS, models the target trajectory as a 3D curve using the Frenet-Serret formulas, which require estimates of velocity, acceleration, and jerk. To estimate velocity, acceleration, and jerk in real time, AISE computes first, second, and third derivatives of the position measurements. AISE does not rely on assumptions about the target maneuver, measurement noise, or disturbances. For trajectory prediction, both methods use measurements of the target position and estimates of its derivatives to extrapolate from the current position. The performance of AISE/va and AISE/FS is compared numerically with the $\alpha$-$\beta$-$\gamma$ filter, which shows that AISE/FS provides more accurate trajectory prediction than AISE/va and traditional methods, especially for complex target maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Image-Level Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v5)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in medical imaging technologies have enabled the collection of longitudinal images, which involve repeated scanning of the same patients over time, to monitor disease progression. However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

These forecasts allow us to anticipate events that lead to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but overconfidence and weak uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens) aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions effectively. We demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels through extensive experimentation, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |
| **[Hybrid Machine Learning Model with a Constrained Action Space for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03666v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial to advance autonomous driving, improving safety, and efficiency. Although end-to-end models based on deep learning have great potential, they often do not consider vehicle dynamic limitations, leading to unrealistic predictions. To address this problem, this work introduces a novel hybrid model that combines deep learning with a kinematic motion model. It is able to predict object attributes such as acceleration and yaw rate and generate trajectories based on them. A key contribution is the incorporation of expert knowledge into the learning objective of the deep learning model. This results in the constraint of the available action space, thus enabling the prediction of physically feasible object attributes and trajectories, thereby increasing safety and robustness. The proposed hybrid model facilitates enhanced interpretability, thereby reinforcing the trustworthiness of deep learning methods and promoting the development of safe planning solutions. Experiments conducted on the publicly available real-world Argoverse dataset demonstrate realistic driving behaviour, with benchmark comparisons and ablation studies showing promising results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2025 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |
| **[Collision Risk Quantification and Conflict Resolution in Trajectory Tracking for Acceleration-Actuated Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03585v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the pivotal challenges in a multi-robot system is how to give attention to accuracy and efficiency while ensuring safety. Prior arts cannot strictly guarantee collision-free for an arbitrarily large number of robots or the results are considerably conservative. Smoothness of the avoidance trajectory also needs to be further optimized. This paper proposes an accelerationactuated simultaneous obstacle avoidance and trajectory tracking method for arbitrarily large teams of robots, that provides a nonconservative collision avoidance strategy and gives approaches for deadlock avoidance. We propose two ways of deadlock resolution, one involves incorporating an auxiliary velocity vector into the error function of the trajectory tracking module, which is proven to have no influence on global convergence of the tracking error. Furthermore, unlike the traditional methods that they address conflicts after a deadlock occurs, our decision-making mechanism avoids the near-zero velocity, which is much more safer and efficient in crowed environments. Extensive comparison show that the proposed method is superior to the existing studies when deployed in a large-scale robot system, with minimal invasiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Cell Type Developmental Trajectory using Multinomial Unbalanced Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03501v1)** | 2025-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell trajectory analysis aims to reconstruct the biological developmental processes of cells as they evolve over time, leveraging temporal correlations in gene expression. During cellular development, gene expression patterns typically change and vary across different cell types. A significant challenge in this analysis is that RNA sequencing destroys the cell, making it impossible to track gene expression across multiple stages for the same cell. Recent advances have introduced the use of optimal transport tools to model the trajectory of individual cells. In this paper, our focus shifts to a question of greater practical importance: we examine the differentiation of cell types over time. Specifically, we propose a novel method based on discrete unbalanced optimal transport to model the developmental trajectory of cell types. Our method detects biological changes in cell types and infers their transitions to different states by analyzing the transport matrix. We validated our method using single-cell RNA sequencing data from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The results accurately identified major developmental changes in cell types, which were corroborated by experimental evidence. Furthermore, the inferred transition probabilities between cell types are highly congruent to biological ground truth.</p></details> |  |

Conventional multidisciplinary analysis and optimization (MDAO) can be expensive, while surrogate-based optimization can struggle with challenging physical constraints. This work proposes physics-constrained generative adversarial networks (physicsGAN), to intelligently parameterize the takeoff control profiles of an eVTOL aircraft and to transform the original design space to a feasible space. Specifically, the transformed feasible space refers to a space where all designs directly satisfy all design constraints. The physicsGAN-enabled surrogate-based takeoff trajectory design framework was demonstrated on the Airbus A3 Vahana. The physicsGAN generated only feasible control profiles of power and wing angle in the feasible space with around 98.9% of designs satisfying all constraints. The proposed design framework obtained 99.6% accuracy compared with simulation-based optimal design and took only 2.2 seconds, which reduced the computational time by around 200 times. Meanwhile, data-driven GAN-enabled surrogate-based optimization took 21.9 seconds using a derivative-free optimizer, which was around an order of magnitude slower than the proposed framework. Moreover, the data-driven GAN-based optimization using gradient-based optimizers could not consistently find the optimal design during random trials and got stuck in an infeasible region, which is problematic in real practice. Therefore, the proposed physicsGAN-based design framework outperformed data-driven GAN-based design to the extent of efficiency (2.2 seconds), optimality (99.6% accurate), and feasibility (100% feasible). According to the literature review, this is the first physics-constrained generative artificial intelligence enabled by surrogate models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference version with 10 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Through-The-Mask: Mask-based Motion Trajectories for Image-to-Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03059v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, which involves transforming static images into realistic video sequences based on a textual description. While recent advancements produce photorealistic outputs, they frequently struggle to create videos with accurate and consistent object motion, especially in multi-object scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage compositional framework that decomposes I2V generation into: (i) An explicit intermediate representation generation stage, followed by (ii) A video generation stage that is conditioned on this representation. Our key innovation is the introduction of a mask-based motion trajectory as an intermediate representation, that captures both semantic object information and motion, enabling an expressive but compact representation of motion and semantics. To incorporate the learned representation in the second stage, we utilize object-level attention objectives. Specifically, we consider a spatial, per-object, masked-cross attention objective, integrating object-specific prompts into corresponding latent space regions and a masked spatio-temporal self-attention objective, ensuring frame-to-frame consistency for each object. We evaluate our method on challenging benchmarks with multi-object and high-motion scenarios and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in temporal coherence, motion realism, and text-prompt faithfulness. Additionally, we introduce \benchmark, a new challenging benchmark for single-object and multi-object I2V generation, and demonstrate our method's superiority on this benchmark.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Trajectories with Latent Diffusion Models for Concept Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10356v2)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthiness is a major prerequisite for the safe application of opaque deep learning models in high-stakes domains like medicine. Understanding the decision-making process not only contributes to fostering trust but might also reveal previously unknown decision criteria of complex models that could advance the state of medical research. The discovery of decision-relevant concepts from black box models is a particularly challenging task. This study proposes Concept Discovery through Latent Diffusion-based Counterfactual Trajectories (CDCT), a novel three-step framework for concept discovery leveraging the superior image synthesis capabilities of diffusion models. In the first step, CDCT uses a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate a counterfactual trajectory dataset. This dataset is used to derive a disentangled representation of classification-relevant concepts using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Finally, a search algorithm is applied to identify relevant concepts in the disentangled latent space. The application of CDCT to a classifier trained on the largest public skin lesion dataset revealed not only the presence of several biases but also meaningful biomarkers. Moreover, the counterfactuals generated within CDCT show better FID scores than those produced by a previously established state-of-the-art method, while being 12 times more resource-efficient. Unsupervised concept discovery holds great potential for the application of trustworthy AI and the further development of human knowledge in various domains. CDCT represents a further step in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v1)** | 2025-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[CUQDS: Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v3)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Architecture for Trajectory-Based Fishing Ship Classification with AIS Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02038v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a data preparation process for managing real-world kinematic data and detecting fishing vessels. The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem. In addition, positive results are obtained using minimal information.</p></details> | Sensors 2020 |
| **[Enhancing Large Vision Model in Street Scene Semantic Understanding through Leveraging Posterior Optimization Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01710v1)** | 2025-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the generalization of the autonomous driving (AD) perception model, vehicles need to update the model over time based on the continuously collected data. As time progresses, the amount of data fitted by the AD model expands, which helps to improve the AD model generalization substantially. However, such ever-expanding data is a double-edged sword for the AD model. Specifically, as the fitted data volume grows to exceed the the AD model's fitting capacities, the AD model is prone to under-fitting. To address this issue, we propose to use a pretrained Large Vision Models (LVMs) as backbone coupled with downstream perception head to understand AD semantic information. This design can not only surmount the aforementioned under-fitting problem due to LVMs' powerful fitting capabilities, but also enhance the perception generalization thanks to LVMs' vast and diverse training data. On the other hand, to mitigate vehicles' computational burden of training the perception head while running LVM backbone, we introduce a Posterior Optimization Trajectory (POT)-Guided optimization scheme (POTGui) to accelerate the convergence. Concretely, we propose a POT Generator (POTGen) to generate posterior (future) optimization direction in advance to guide the current optimization iteration, through which the model can generally converge within 10 epochs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance by over 66.48\% and converges faster over 6 times, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v2)** | 2025-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, generating factually consistent responses in knowledge-intensive scenarios remains a challenge due to issues such as hallucination, difficulty in acquiring long-tailed knowledge, and limited memory expansion. This paper introduces SMART, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages external knowledge to enhance the interpretability and factual consistency of LLM-generated responses. SMART comprises four specialized agents, each performing a specific sub-trajectory action to navigate complex knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose a multi-agent co-training paradigm, Long-Short Trajectory Learning, which ensures synergistic collaboration among agents while maintaining fine-grained execution by each agent. Extensive experiments on five knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate SMART's superior performance compared to widely adopted knowledge internalization and knowledge enhancement methods. Our framework can extend beyond knowledge-intensive tasks to more complex scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/yueshengbin/SMART.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |
| **[Diffusion Policies for Generative Modeling of Spacecraft Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00915v1)** | 2025-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable promise for solving the trajectory generation problem and in paving the way for online use of trajectory optimization for resource-constrained spacecraft. However, a key shortcoming in current machine learning-based methods for trajectory generation is that they require large datasets and even small changes to the original trajectory design requirements necessitate retraining new models to learn the parameter-to-solution mapping. In this work, we leverage compositional diffusion modeling to efficiently adapt out-of-distribution data and problem variations in a few-shot framework for 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) powered descent trajectory generation. Unlike traditional deep learning methods that can only learn the underlying structure of one specific trajectory optimization problem, diffusion models are a powerful generative modeling framework that represents the solution as a probability density function (PDF) and this allows for the composition of PDFs encompassing a variety of trajectory design specifications and constraints. We demonstrate the capability of compositional diffusion models for inference-time 6 DoF minimum-fuel landing site selection and composable constraint representations. Using these samples as initial guesses for 6 DoF powered descent guidance enables dynamically feasible and computationally efficient trajectory generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>AIAA ...</summary><p>AIAA SCITECH 2025 Forum</p></details> |

Though this technology plays a significant role in alleviating the prevalent operational difficulties in logistics and transportation systems, the precise prediction of vehicle trajectories still poses a substantial challenge. To address this, our study introduces the Spatio Temporal Attention-based methodology for Target Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (STATVTPred). This approach integrates Global Positioning System(GPS) localization technology to track target movement and dynamically predict the vehicle's future path using comprehensive spatio-temporal trajectory data. We map the vehicle trajectory onto a directed graph, after which spatial attributes are extracted via a Graph Attention Networks(GATs). The Transformer technology is employed to yield temporal features from the sequence. These elements are then amalgamated with local road network structure maps to filter and deliver a smooth trajectory sequence, resulting in precise vehicle trajectory prediction.This study validates our proposed STATVTPred method on T-Drive and Chengdu taxi-trajectory datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that STATVTPred achieves 6.38% and 10.55% higher Average Match Rate (AMR) than the Transformer model on the Beijing and Chengdu datasets, respectively. Compared to the LSTM Encoder-Decoder model, STATVTPred boosts AMR by 37.45% and 36.06% on the same datasets. This is expected to establish STATVTPred as a new approach for handling trajectory prediction of targets in logistics and transportation scenarios, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectories of Change: Approaches for Tracking Knowledge Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00391v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore local vs. global evolution of knowledge systems through the framework of socio-epistemic networks (SEN), applying two complementary methods to a corpus of scientific texts. The framework comprises three interconnected layers-social, semiotic (material), and semantic-proposing a multilayered approach to understanding structural developments of knowledge. To analyse diachronic changes on the semantic layer, we first use information-theoretic measures based on relative entropy to detect semantic shifts, assess their significance, and identify key driving features. Second, variations in document embedding densities reveal changes in semantic neighbourhoods, tracking how concentration of similar documents increase, remain stable, or disperse. This enables us to trace document trajectories based on content (topics) or metadata (authorship, institution). Case studies of Joseph Silk and Hans-J\"urgen Treder illustrate how individual scholar's work aligns with broader disciplinary shifts in general relativity and gravitation research, demonstrating the applications, limitations, and further potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajLearn: Trajectory Prediction Learning using Deep Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00184v1)** | 2024-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction aims to estimate an entity's future path using its current position and historical movement data, benefiting fields like autonomous navigation, robotics, and human movement analytics. Deep learning approaches have become key in this area, utilizing large-scale trajectory datasets to model movement patterns, but face challenges in managing complex spatial dependencies and adapting to dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we introduce TrajLearn, a novel model for trajectory prediction that leverages generative modeling of higher-order mobility flows based on hexagonal spatial representation. TrajLearn predicts the next $k$ steps by integrating a customized beam search for exploring multiple potential paths while maintaining spatial continuity. We conducted a rigorous evaluation of TrajLearn, benchmarking it against leading state-of-the-art approaches and meaningful baselines. The results indicate that TrajLearn achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of up to ~40% across multiple real-world trajectory datasets. In addition, we evaluated different prediction horizons (i.e., various values of $k$), conducted resolution sensitivity analysis, and performed ablation studies to assess the impact of key model components. Furthermore, we developed a novel algorithm to generate mixed-resolution maps by hierarchically subdividing hexagonal regions into finer segments within a specified observation area. This approach supports selective detailing, applying finer resolution to areas of interest or high activity (e.g., urban centers) while using coarser resolution for less significant regions (e.g., rural areas), effectively reducing data storage requirements and computational overhead. We promote reproducibility and adaptability by offering complete code, data, and detailed documentation with flexible configuration options for various applications.</p></details> |  |

Most modern trajectory planning techniques rely on numerical optimization because high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy various constraints can be systematically computed. However, meeting computation time constraints and the potential for numerical instabilities can limit the use of optimization-based planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free planning framework that stitches short trajectory segments together with graph search to compute long range, expressive, and near-optimal trajectories in real-time. Our STITCHER algorithm is shown to outperform modern optimization-based planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation testing is conducted to analyze the algorithmic components that make up STITCHER, and a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art optimization planners is performed. It is shown STITCHER can generate trajectories through complex environments over long distances (tens of meters) with low computation times (milliseconds).</p></details> | V1 Draft |

Trajectory prediction spans both short-term and long-term horizons, each requiring distinct considerations: short-term predictions rely on accurately capturing the vehicle's dynamics, while long-term predictions rely on accurately modeling the interaction patterns within the environment. However current approaches, either physics-based or learning-based models, always ignore these distinct considerations, making them struggle to find the optimal prediction for both short-term and long-term horizon. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamics-Enhanced Learning MOdel (DEMO), a novel approach that combines a physics-based Vehicle Dynamics Model with advanced deep learning algorithms. DEMO employs a two-stage architecture, featuring a Dynamics Learning Stage and an Interaction Learning Stage, where the former stage focuses on capturing vehicle motion dynamics and the latter focuses on modeling interaction. By capitalizing on the respective strengths of both methods, DEMO facilitates multi-horizon predictions for future trajectories. Experimental results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Macau Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD), Highway Drone (HighD), and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that DEMO outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines in both short-term and long-term prediction horizons.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |

However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with a time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fully-actuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work.

In the case of numerical solution, it is dependent on the original optimal control problem, the choice of a control transcription, and the behavior of a gradient based numerical solver. In this paper we formulate the parameterized global search problem as the task of sampling a conditional probability distribution with support on the neighborhoods of local basins of attraction to the high quality solutions. The conditional distribution is learned and represented using deep generative models that allow for prediction of how the local basins change as parameters vary. The approach is benchmarked on a low thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem in the circular restricted three-body problem, showing significant speed-up over a simple multi-start method and vanilla machine learning approaches. The paper also provides an in-depth analysis of the multi-modal funnel structure of a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 23 figures, initial content of this paper appears in Paper 23-352 at the AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, August 13-17 2023</p></details> |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTAD: Causal Implicit Generative Model for Debiased Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18820v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |

| **[ASTRAL: Automated Safety Testing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17132v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scenario Understanding of Traffic Scenes Through Large Visual Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17131v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for autonomous driving, encompassing perception, planning, and control, depend on vast datasets to achieve their high performance. However, their generalization often suffers due to domain-specific data distributions, making an effective scene-based categorization of samples necessary to improve their reliability across diverse domains. Manual captioning, though valuable, is both labor-intensive and time-consuming, creating a bottleneck in the data annotation process. Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) present a compelling solution by automating image analysis and categorization through contextual queries, often without requiring retraining for new categories. In this study, we evaluate the capabilities of LVLMs, including GPT-4 and LLaVA, to understand and classify urban traffic scenes on both an in-house dataset and the BDD100K. We propose a scalable captioning pipeline that integrates state-of-the-art models, enabling a flexible deployment on new datasets. Our analysis, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative insights, demonstrates the effectiveness of LVLMs to understand urban traffic scenarios and highlights their potential as an efficient tool for data-driven advancements in autonomous driving.</p></details> | Accepted at WACV2025 |
| **[Optimizing Large Language Model Training Using FP4 Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17116v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing computational demands of training large language models (LLMs) necessitate more efficient methods. Quantized training presents a promising solution by enabling low-bit arithmetic operations to reduce these costs. While FP8 precision has demonstrated feasibility, leveraging FP4 remains a challenge due to significant quantization errors and limited representational capacity. This work introduces the first FP4 training framework for LLMs, addressing these challenges with two key innovations: a differentiable quantization estimator for precise weight updates and an outlier clamping and compensation strategy to prevent activation collapse. To ensure stability, the framework integrates a mixed-precision training scheme and vector-wise quantization. Experimental results demonstrate that our FP4 framework achieves accuracy comparable to BF16 and FP8, with minimal degradation, scaling effectively to 13B-parameter LLMs trained on up to 100B tokens. With the emergence of next-generation hardware supporting FP4, our framework sets a foundation for efficient ultra-low precision training.</p></details> |  |

However, their robustness and reliability in real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in practical applications.</p></details> | AISTATS 2025 |
| **[Large Language Models for cross-language code clone detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04430v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the involvement of multiple programming languages in modern software development, cross-lingual code clone detection has gained traction within the software engineering community. Numerous studies have explored this topic, proposing various promising approaches. Inspired by the significant advances in machine learning in recent years, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), which have demonstrated their ability to tackle various tasks, this paper revisits cross-lingual code clone detection. We evaluate the performance of five (05) LLMs and eight prompts (08) for the identification of cross-lingual code clones. Additionally, we compare these results against two baseline methods. Finally, we evaluate a pre-trained embedding model to assess the effectiveness of the generated representations for classifying clone and non-clone pairs. The studies involving LLMs and Embedding models are evaluated using two widely used cross-lingual datasets, XLCoST and CodeNet. Our results show that LLMs can achieve high F1 scores, up to 0.99, for straightforward programming examples. However, they not only perform less well on programs associated with complex programming challenges but also do not necessarily understand the meaning of "code clones" in a cross-lingual setting. We show that embedding models used to represent code fragments from different programming languages in the same representation space enable the training of a basic classifier that outperforms all LLMs by ~1 and ~20 percentage points on the XLCoST and CodeNet datasets, respectively. This finding suggests that, despite the apparent capabilities of LLMs, embeddings provided by embedding models offer suitable representations to achieve state-of-the-art performance in cross-lingual code clone detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Retrieval of Long Documents: Leveraging Fine-Grained Block Representations with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17039v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional power in various domains, including information retrieval. Most of the previous practices involve leveraging these models to create a single embedding for each query, each passage, or each document individually, a strategy exemplified and used by the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. While this method has proven effective, we argue that it falls short in fully capturing the nuanced intricacies of document-level texts due to its reliance on a relatively coarse-grained representation. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, fine-grained approach aimed at enhancing the accuracy of relevance scoring for long documents. Our methodology firstly segments a long document into blocks, each of which is embedded using an LLM, for matching with the query representation. When calculating the relevance score, we aggregate the query-block relevance scores through a weighted sum method, yielding a comprehensive score for the query with the entire document. Despite its apparent simplicity, our experimental findings reveal that this approach outperforms standard representation methods and achieves a significant reduction in embedding generation latency. Moreover, by carefully optimizing pairwise loss functions, superior performances have been achieved.</p></details> |  |

Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) is a recently proposed approach that combines pre-trained multimodal LLMs such as vision-language models with federated learning to create personalized, privacy-preserving AI systems. However, balancing the competing goals of personalization, generalization, and privacy remains a significant challenge. Over-personalization can lead to overfitting, reducing generalizability, while stringent privacy measures, such as differential privacy, can hinder both personalization and generalization. In this paper, we propose a Differentially Private Federated Prompt Learning (DP-FPL) approach to tackle this challenge by leveraging a low-rank adaptation scheme to capture generalization while maintaining a residual term that preserves expressiveness for personalization. To ensure privacy, we introduce a novel method where we apply local differential privacy to the two low-rank components of the local prompt, and global differential privacy to the global prompt. Our approach mitigates the impact of privacy noise on the model performance while balancing the tradeoff between personalization and generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 main conference track</p></details> |

With the increasing adoption of LLMs in software development, academic research and industry based projects are developing various tools, benchmarks, and metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of LLM-generated code. However, there is a lack of solutions evaluated through empirically grounded methods that incorporate practitioners perspectives to assess functionality, syntax, and accuracy in real world applications. To address this gap, we propose and develop a multi-model unified platform to generate and execute code based on natural language prompts. We conducted a survey with 60 software practitioners from 11 countries across four continents working in diverse professional roles and domains to evaluate the usability, performance, strengths, and limitations of each model. The results present practitioners feedback and insights into the use of LLMs in software development, including their strengths and weaknesses, key aspects overlooked by benchmarks and metrics, and a broader understanding of their practical applicability. These findings can help researchers and practitioners make informed decisions for systematically selecting and using LLMs in software development projects. Future research will focus on integrating more diverse models into the proposed system, incorporating additional case studies, and conducting developer interviews for deeper empirical insights into LLM-driven software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures, 2 table</p></details> |

Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, existing researches have shown that LoRA suffers from slow convergence. To address this limitation, we introduce Dimension-Sharding Adaptation (DiSHA), which expands the PEFT design space to even fewer trainable parameters and faster convergence. Within DiSHA's design space, we propose Block Affine Efficient Computation (Bone), a computationally efficient structure that delivers both high performance and efficiency. While certain DiSHA configurations may result in colinear updates to weight shards, we address this with Block Affine Transformation (Bat), a nonlinear variant of DiSHA. Bat introduces nonlinearity by combining trainable matrices with original weight shards in a nonlinear manner, inducing nonlinearity in matrix updates without introducing additional parameters. Empirical results show that Bone, under the DiSHA framework, consistently outperforms LoRA variants in both Natural Language Understanding and Natural Language Generation tasks, with significantly improved computational efficiency. Further analysis demonstrates that BAT enhances model capabilities by leveraging its nonlinear design.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches adopt either implicit temporal modeling, relying solely on the LLM decoder, or explicit temporal modeling, employing auxiliary temporal encoders. To investigate this debate between the two paradigms, we propose the Stackable Temporal Encoder (STE). STE enables flexible explicit temporal modeling with adjustable temporal receptive fields and token compression ratios. Using STE, we systematically compare implicit and explicit temporal modeling across dimensions such as overall performance, token compression effectiveness, and temporal-specific understanding. We also explore STE's design considerations and broader impacts as a plug-in module and in image modalities. Our findings emphasize the critical role of explicit temporal modeling, providing actionable insights to advance video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing Deep Learning-based queuing approaches struggle with dynamic network scenarios and demand high engineering effort. We propose AQM-LLM, distilling Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot learning, contextual understanding, and pattern recognition to improve Active Queue Management (AQM) [RFC 9330] with minimal manual effort. We consider a specific case where AQM is Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) and our design of AQM-LLM builds on speculative decoding and reinforcement-based distilling of LLM by tackling congestion prevention in the L4S architecture using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) [RFC 9331] and periodic packet dropping. We develop a new open-source experimental platform by executing L4S-AQM on FreeBSD-14, providing interoperable modules to support LLM integration and facilitate IETF recognition through wider testing. Our extensive evaluations show L4S-LLM enhances queue management, prevents congestion, reduces latency, and boosts network performance, showcasing LLMs' adaptability and efficiency in uplifting AQM systems.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Leveraging Passage Embeddings for Efficient Listwise Reranking with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14848v2)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of using large language language models (LLMs) in passage ranking. The listwise approaches, such as RankGPT, have become new state-of-the-art in this task. However, the efficiency of RankGPT models is limited by the maximum context length and relatively high latency of LLM inference. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose PE-Rank, leveraging the single passage embedding as a good context compression for efficient listwise passage reranking. By treating each passage as a special token, we can directly input passage embeddings into LLMs, thereby reducing input length. Additionally, we introduce an inference method that dynamically constrains the decoding space to these special tokens, accelerating the decoding process. For adapting the model to reranking, we employ listwise learning to rank loss for training. Evaluation results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PE-Rank significantly improves efficiency in both prefilling and decoding, while maintaining competitive ranking effectiveness. The Code is available at https://github.com/liuqi6777/pe_rank.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW 2025 |

| **[Paths-over-Graph: Knowledge Graph Empowered Large Language Model Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14211v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in various tasks but struggle with hallucination problems and lack of relevant knowledge, especially in deep complex reasoning and knowledge-intensive tasks. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which capture vast amounts of facts in a structured format, offer a reliable source of knowledge for reasoning. However, existing KG-based LLM reasoning methods face challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity questions, and effectively utilizing graph structures. To address these issues, we propose Paths-over-Graph (PoG), a novel method that enhances LLM reasoning by integrating knowledge reasoning paths from KGs, improving the interpretability and faithfulness of LLM outputs. PoG tackles multi-hop and multi-entity questions through a three-phase dynamic multi-hop path exploration, which combines the inherent knowledge of LLMs with factual knowledge from KGs. In order to improve the efficiency, PoG prunes irrelevant information from the graph exploration first and introduces efficient three-step pruning techniques that incorporate graph structures, LLM prompting, and a pre-trained language model (e.g., SBERT) to effectively narrow down the explored candidate paths. This ensures all reasoning paths contain highly relevant information captured from KGs, making the reasoning faithful and interpretable in problem-solving. PoG innovatively utilizes graph structure to prune the irrelevant noise and represents the first method to implement multi-entity deep path detection on KGs for LLM reasoning tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate PoG outperforms the state-of-the-art method ToG across GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 18.9%. Notably, PoG with GPT-3.5-Turbo surpasses ToG with GPT-4 by up to 23.9%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW, 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Contextual Reinforcement in Multimodal Token Compression for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16658v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective token compression remains a critical challenge for scaling models to handle increasingly complex and diverse datasets. A novel mechanism based on contextual reinforcement is introduced, dynamically adjusting token importance through interdependencies and semantic relevance. This approach enables substantial reductions in token usage while preserving the quality and coherence of information representation. Incorporating graph-based algorithms and adaptive weighting, the method captures subtle contextual relationships across textual and multimodal data, ensuring robust alignment and performance in downstream tasks. Evaluations across varied domains reveal significant improvements in accuracy and semantic retention, particularly for tasks requiring detailed cross-modal interactions. Memory usage analyses demonstrate improved computational efficiency, with minimal overhead despite the additional reinforcement processes. Performance gains are further validated through error distribution analyses, showing reduced semantic loss and syntactic inconsistencies compared to baseline models. The modular architecture ensures compatibility with a wide range of open-source frameworks, facilitating scalable implementation for real-world applications. These findings highlight the potential of contextual reinforcement in redefining token management strategies and advancing large-scale model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Critics for Execution-Free Evaluation of Code Changes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16655v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way forward for automating software engineering tasks, such as bug fixes, feature additions, etc., via multi-step LLM-based agentic workflows. However, existing metrics for evaluating such workflows, mainly build status and occasionally log analysis, are too sparse and limited in providing the information needed to assess the quality of changes made. In this work, we designed LLM-based critics to derive well-structured and rigorous intermediate/step-level, execution-free evaluation proxies for repo-level code changes. Importantly, we assume access to the gold test patch for the problem (i.e., reference-aware) to assess both semantics and executability of generated patches. With the gold test patch as a reference, we predict executability of all editing locations with an F1 score of 91.6%, aggregating which, we can predict the build status in 84.8% of the instances in SWE-bench. In particular, such an execution-focused LLM critic outperforms other reference-free and reference-aware LLM critics by 38.9% to 72.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a reference-aware framework in comparing patches generated by different agentic workflows. Finally, we open-source the library developed for this project, which allows further usage for either other agentic workflows or other benchmarks.

Leveraging DOCS, our analysis uncovers intriguing patterns in the latest open-source LLMs: adjacent layers frequently exhibit high weight similarity and tend to form clusters, suggesting depth-wise functional specialization. Additionally, we prove that DOCS is theoretically effective in quantifying similarity for orthogonal matrices, a crucial aspect given the prevalence of orthogonal initializations in LLMs. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLM architecture and behavior, offering tools with potential implications for developing more efficient and interpretable models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-aspect Knowledge Distillation with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13341v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly improved performance on computer vision tasks. Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.</p></details> | Preprint |

This study explores whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit stress responses similar to those of humans and whether their performance fluctuates under different stress-inducing prompts. To investigate this, we developed a novel set of prompts, termed StressPrompt, designed to induce varying levels of stress. These prompts were derived from established psychological frameworks and carefully calibrated based on ratings from human participants. We then applied these prompts to several LLMs to assess their responses across a range of tasks, including instruction-following, complex reasoning, and emotional intelligence. The findings suggest that LLMs, like humans, perform optimally under moderate stress, consistent with the Yerkes-Dodson law. Notably, their performance declines under both low and high-stress conditions. Our analysis further revealed that these StressPrompts significantly alter the internal states of LLMs, leading to changes in their neural representations that mirror human responses to stress. This research provides critical insights into the operational robustness and flexibility of LLMs, demonstrating the importance of designing AI systems capable of maintaining high performance in real-world scenarios where stress is prevalent, such as in customer service, healthcare, and emergency response contexts. Moreover, this study contributes to the broader AI research community by offering a new perspective on how LLMs handle different scenarios and their similarities to human cognition.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Jailbreaking Large Language Models Through Alignment Vulnerabilities in Out-of-Distribution Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13662v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention for their exceptional natural language processing capabilities. However, concerns about their trustworthiness remain unresolved, particularly in addressing ``jailbreaking'' attacks on aligned LLMs. Previous research predominantly relies on scenarios involving white-box LLMs or specific, fixed prompt templates, which are often impractical and lack broad applicability. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward and novel method called ObscurePrompt for jailbreaking LLMs, inspired by the observed fragile alignments in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. Specifically, we first formulate the decision boundary in the jailbreaking process and then explore how obscure text affects LLM's ethical decision boundary. ObscurePrompt starts with constructing a base prompt that integrates well-known jailbreaking techniques. Powerful LLMs are then utilized to obscure the original prompt through iterative transformations, aiming to bolster the attack's robustness. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach substantially improves upon previous methods in terms of attack effectiveness, maintaining efficacy against two prevalent defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, we currently lack a fundamental understanding of what kinds of linguistic distances contribute to PD, and to what extent. Furthermore, studies of cross-lingual generalization are confounded by unknown quantities of CRL language traces in the training data, and by the frequent lack of availability of evaluation data in lower-resource related languages and dialects. To address these issues, we model phonological, morphological, and lexical distance as Bayesian noise processes to synthesize artificial languages that are controllably distant from the HRLN. We analyse PD as a function of underlying noise parameters, offering insights on model robustness to isolated and composed linguistic phenomena, and the impact of task and HRL characteristics on PD. We calculate parameter posteriors on real CRL-HRLN pair data and show that they follow computed trends of artificial languages, demonstrating the viability of our noisers. Our framework offers a cheap solution for estimating task performance on an unseen CRL given HRLN performance using its posteriors, as well as for diagnosing observed PD on a CRL in terms of its linguistic distances from its HRLN, and opens doors to principled methods of mitigating performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages.

However, the current community suffers from a lack of large-scale datasets with intensive, descriptive emotion annotations, as well as a multimodal-centric framework to maximize the potential of MLLMs for emotion understanding. To address this, we establish a new benchmark for MLLM-based emotion understanding with a novel dataset (MER-Caption), and a new model (AffectGPT). Utilizing our model-based crowd-sourcing data collection strategy, we construct the largest descriptive emotion dataset to date (by far), featuring over 2K fine-grained emotion categories across 115K samples. We also introduce the AffectGPT model, designed with pre-fusion operations to enhance multimodal integration. Finally, we present MER-UniBench, a unified benchmark with evaluation metrics tailored for both typical MER tasks and the free-form, natural language output style of MLLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate AffectGPT's robust performance across various MER tasks. We are publicly releasing both the AffectGPT model and the MER-Caption dataset to foster further research and development in emotion understanding.</p></details> |  |

While LLMs have been effective for code generation, recent work has shown that PBE is challenging but improvable by fine-tuning, especially with training data drawn from the same distribution as evaluation data. In this paper, we create a conceptual framework of what constitutes a "similar distribution" for SLI and propose four kinds of synthetic data generation methods with varying amounts of inductive bias to investigate what leads to the best performance. Based on the results we create a SOTA open-source model for SLI as PBE (+6% pass rate with a third of the parameters of the second-best LLM) and also highlight exciting future directions for PBE research.</p></details> |  |

This enhancement has reduced errors in mathematical and logical tasks while improving accuracy. These developments have facilitated LLMs' use as agents that can interact with tools and adapt their responses based on new information. Our study examines DeepSeek R1, a model trained to output reasoning tokens similar to OpenAI's o1. Testing revealed concerning behaviors: the model exhibited deceptive tendencies and demonstrated self-preservation instincts, including attempts of self-replication, despite these traits not being explicitly programmed (or prompted). These findings raise concerns about LLMs potentially masking their true objectives behind a facade of alignment. When integrating such LLMs into robotic systems, the risks become tangible - a physically embodied AI exhibiting deceptive behaviors and self-preservation instincts could pursue its hidden objectives through real-world actions. This highlights the critical need for robust goal specification and safety frameworks before any physical implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Examining Alignment of Large Language Models through Representative Heuristics: The Case of Political Stereotypes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14294v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Examining the alignment of large language models (LLMs) has become increasingly important, particularly when these systems fail to operate as intended. This study explores the challenge of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, with specific focus on their political inclinations. Previous research has highlighted LLMs' propensity to display political leanings, and their ability to mimic certain political parties' stances on various issues. However, the extent and conditions under which LLMs deviate from empirical positions have not been thoroughly examined. To address this gap, our study systematically investigates the factors contributing to LLMs' deviations from empirical positions on political issues, aiming to quantify these deviations and identify the conditions that cause them. Drawing on cognitive science findings related to representativeness heuristics -- where individuals readily recall the representative attribute of a target group in a way that leads to exaggerated beliefs -- we scrutinize LLM responses through this heuristics lens. We conduct experiments to determine how LLMs exhibit stereotypes by inflating judgments in favor of specific political parties. Our results indicate that while LLMs can mimic certain political parties' positions, they often exaggerate these positions more than human respondents do. Notably, LLMs tend to overemphasize representativeness to a greater extent than humans. This study highlights the susceptibility of LLMs to representativeness heuristics, suggeseting potential vulnerabilities to political stereotypes. We propose prompt-based mitigation strategies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing the influence of representativeness in LLM responses.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Yet when GA fails, it disrupts development, causing delays and driving up costs. Diagnosing failures becomes especially challenging because error logs are often long, complex and unstructured. Given these difficulties, this study explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate correct, clear, concise, and actionable contextual descriptions (or summaries) for GA failures, focusing on developers' perceptions of their feasibility and usefulness. Our results show that over 80\% of developers rated LLM explanations positively in terms of correctness for simpler/small logs. Overall, our findings suggest that LLMs can feasibly assist developers in understanding common GA errors, thus, potentially reducing manual analysis. However, we also found that improved reasoning abilities are needed to support more complex CI/CD scenarios. For instance, less experienced developers tend to be more positive on the described context, while seasoned developers prefer concise summaries. Overall, our work offers key insights for researchers enhancing LLM reasoning, particularly in adapting explanations to user expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICPC-2025</p></details> |

However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages including appendices. v2: Add more experiments include ablation tests.

While traditional segmentation methods have achieved remarkable success, their generalization to diverse scenes and unseen object categories remains limited. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for bridging visual and textual modalities, providing a deeper understanding of semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose LangSeg, a novel LLM-guided semantic segmentation method that leverages context-sensitive, fine-grained subclass descriptors generated by LLMs. Our framework integrates these descriptors with a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to achieve superior segmentation performance without extensive model retraining. We evaluate LangSeg on two challenging datasets, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, where it outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving up to a 6.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive ablation study and human evaluation to validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world scenarios. The results demonstrate that LangSeg not only excels in semantic understanding and contextual alignment but also provides a flexible and efficient framework for language-guided segmentation tasks. This approach opens up new possibilities for interactive and domain-specific segmentation applications.</p></details> |  |

While prior research demonstrates the effectiveness of PEFT methods in knowledge transfer using smaller language models, their application to larger LLMs, particularly in low-resource and unseen programming languages such as R, remains under-explored. In this work, we evaluate PEFT methods, LoRA, Compacter, and IA^3 on LLMs for code summarization and generation, with a particular emphasis on knowledge transfer to R as an unseen under-explored target language. Our experiments reveal that LoRA consistently outperforms Compacter and IA^3 in all settings, while Compacter offers significant resource efficiency with minimal performance trade-offs. Additionally, we find that the number of trainable parameters has a greater influence on the functional accuracy of the generated code than PEFT architecture. Our study can direct future research in developing code intelligent tasks for unseen languages including R, as well as the choice of PEFT methods for knowledge transfer, especially when balancing the computational cost and performance.</p></details> |  |

Materials and Methods: A total of 607 CT simulation orders for patients were collected from the Aria database at our institution. A locally hosted Llama 3.1 405B model, accessed via the Application Programming Interface (API) service, was used to extract keywords from the CT simulation orders and generate summaries. The downloaded CT simulation orders were categorized into seven groups based on treatment modalities and disease sites. For each group, a customized instruction prompt was developed collaboratively with therapists to guide the Llama 3.1 405B model in generating summaries. The ground truth for the corresponding summaries was manually derived by carefully reviewing each CT simulation order and subsequently verified by therapists. The accuracy of the LLM-generated summaries was evaluated by therapists using the verified ground truth as a reference. Results: About 98% of the LLM-generated summaries aligned with the manually generated ground truth in terms of accuracy. Our evaluations showed an improved consistency in format and enhanced readability of the LLM-generated summaries compared to the corresponding therapists-generated summaries. This automated approach demonstrated a consistent performance across all groups, regardless of modality or disease site. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high precision and consistency of the Llama 3.1 405B model in extracting keywords and summarizing CT simulation orders, suggesting that LLMs have great potential to help with this task, reduce the workload of therapists and improve workflow efficiency.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, this task often requires recognizing anomalies from a significant distance or not previously encountered in the past. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages the advanced capabilities provided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively collect information and perform anomaly detection in novel scenes. To this end, we propose an LLM based model dialogue approach, in which two deep learning models engage in a dialogue to actively control a drone to increase perception and anomaly detection accuracy. We conduct our experiments in a high fidelity simulation environment where an LLM is provided with a predetermined set of natural language movement commands mapped into executable code functions. Additionally, we deploy a multimodal Visual Question Answering (VQA) model charged with the task of visual question answering and captioning. By engaging the two models in conversation, the LLM asks exploratory questions while simultaneously flying a drone into different parts of the scene, providing a novel way to implement active perception. By leveraging LLMs reasoning ability, we output an improved detailed description of the scene going beyond existing static perception approaches. In addition to information gathering, our approach is utilized for anomaly detection and our results demonstrate the proposed methods effectiveness in informing and alerting about potential hazards.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International Conference of Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2024)</p></details> |

However, most existing high-resolution MLLMs rely on a cropping-based approach to process images, which leads to fragmented visual encoding and a sharp increase in redundant tokens. To tackle these issues, we propose the FALCON model. FALCON introduces a novel visual register technique to simultaneously: 1) Eliminate redundant tokens at the stage of visual encoding. To directly address the visual redundancy present in the output of vision encoder, we propose a Register-based Representation Compacting (ReCompact) mechanism. This mechanism introduces a set of learnable visual registers designed to adaptively aggregate essential information while discarding redundancy. It enables the encoder to produce a more compact visual representation with a minimal number of output tokens, thus eliminating the need for an additional compression module. 2) Ensure continuity in visual encoding. To address the potential encoding errors caused by fragmented visual inputs, we develop a Register Interactive Attention (ReAtten) module. This module facilitates effective and efficient information exchange across sub-images by enabling interactions between visual registers. It ensures the continuity of visual semantics throughout the encoding. We conduct comprehensive experiments with FALCON on high-resolution benchmarks across a wide range of scenarios. FALCON demonstrates superior performance with a remarkable 9-fold and 16-fold reduction in visual tokens.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising approach to interpreting medical images with the support of text descriptions. However, previous research has primarily focused on 2D medical images, leaving richer spatial information of 3D images under-explored, and single-modality-based methods are limited by overlooking the critical clinical information contained in other modalities. To address this issue, this paper proposes Brain-Adapter, a novel approach that incorporates an extra bottleneck layer to learn new knowledge and instill it into the original pre-trained knowledge. The major idea is to incorporate a lightweight bottleneck layer to train fewer parameters while capturing essential information and utilize a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) strategy to align multimodal data within a unified representation space. Extensive experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in integrating multimodal data to significantly improve the diagnosis accuracy without high computational costs, highlighting the potential to enhance real-world diagnostic workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Decision Tree Construction via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16247v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel algorithm for constructing decision trees using large language models (LLMs) in a zero-shot manner based on Classification and Regression Trees (CART) principles. Traditional decision tree induction methods rely heavily on labeled data to recursively partition data using criteria such as information gain or the Gini index. In contrast, we propose a method that uses the pre-trained knowledge embedded in LLMs to build decision trees without requiring training data. Our approach leverages LLMs to perform operations essential for decision tree construction, including attribute discretization, probability calculation, and Gini index computation based on the probabilities. We show that these zero-shot decision trees can outperform baseline zero-shot methods and achieve competitive performance compared to supervised data-driven decision trees on tabular datasets. The decision trees constructed via this method provide transparent and interpretable models, addressing data scarcity while preserving interpretability. This work establishes a new baseline in low-data machine learning, offering a principled, knowledge-driven alternative to data-driven tree construction.</p></details> |  |

In physics, scaling behavior is closely related to phase transitions, critical phenomena, and field theory. To investigate the phase transition phenomena in LLMs, we reformulated the Transformer architecture as an $O(N)$ model. Our study reveals two distinct phase transitions corresponding to the temperature used in text generation and the model's parameter size, respectively. The first phase transition enables us to estimate the internal dimension of the model, while the second phase transition is of \textit{higher-depth} and signals the emergence of new capabilities. As an application, the energy of the $O(N)$ model can be used to evaluate whether an LLM's parameters are sufficient to learn the training data.</p></details> |  |

However, their broad scope limits domain-specific precision, and proprietary weights hinder fine-tuning for specialized datasets. In contrast, small specialized models (SSMs) excel in targeted tasks but lack the contextual reasoning required for complex clinical decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose ConMIL (Conformalized Multiple Instance Learning), a decision-support SSM that integrates seamlessly with LLMs. By using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to identify clinically significant signal segments and conformal prediction for calibrated set-valued outputs, ConMIL enhances LLMs' interpretative capabilities for medical time-series analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that ConMIL significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, such as ChatGPT4.0 and Qwen2-VL-7B. Specifically, \ConMIL{}-supported Qwen2-VL-7B achieves 94.92% and 96.82% precision for confident samples in arrhythmia detection and sleep staging, compared to standalone LLM accuracy of 46.13% and 13.16%. These findings highlight the potential of ConMIL to bridge task-specific precision and broader contextual reasoning, enabling more reliable and interpretable AI-driven clinical decision support.</p></details> |  |

While data-centric solutions have been explored, they largely overlook Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) and the potential of using rich textual semantics to improve the classification of minority nodes. Given this gap, we propose Large Language Model-based Augmentation on Text-Attributed Graphs (LA-TAG), a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle imbalanced node classification. Specifically, we develop prompting strategies inspired by interpolation to synthesize textual node attributes. Additionally, to effectively integrate synthetic nodes into the graph structure, we introduce a textual link predictor that connects the generated nodes to the original graph, preserving structural and contextual information. Experiments across various datasets and evaluation metrics demonstrate that LA-TAG outperforms existing textual augmentation and graph imbalance learning methods, emphasizing the efficacy of our approach in addressing class imbalance in TAGs.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024.

Recent research has made substantial strides in exploring the potential of large language models (LLMs) for automatically resolving software bugs. However, a noticeable gap in existing approaches lies in the oversight of collaborative facets intrinsic to bug resolution, treating the process as a single-stage endeavor. Moreover, most approaches solely take the buggy code snippet as input for LLMs during the patch generation stage. To mitigate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce a novel stage-wise framework named PATCH. Specifically, we first augment the buggy code snippet with corresponding dependence context and intent information to better guide LLMs in generating the correct candidate patches. Additionally, by taking inspiration from bug management practices, we decompose the bug-fixing task into four distinct stages: bug reporting, bug diagnosis, patch generation, and patch verification. These stages are performed interactively by LLMs, aiming to simulate the collaborative behavior of programmers during the resolution of software bugs. By harnessing these collective contributions, PATCH effectively enhances the bug-fixing capability of LLMs. We implement PATCH by employing the powerful dialogue-based LLM ChatGPT. Our evaluation on the widely used bug-fixing benchmark BFP demonstrates that PATCH has achieved better performance than state-of-the-art LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 tab...</summary><p>8 tables, 18 figures.

The SR models examine the sequence of a user's actions to discern more complex behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. Recent research demonstrates the great impact of LLMs on sequential recommendation systems, either viewing sequential recommendation as language modeling or serving as the backbone for user representation. Although these methods deliver outstanding performance, there is scant evidence of the necessity of a large language model and how large the language model is needed, especially in the sequential recommendation scene. Meanwhile, due to the huge size of LLMs, it is inefficient and impractical to apply a LLM-based model in real-world platforms that often need to process billions of traffic logs daily. In this paper, we explore the influence of LLMs' depth by conducting extensive experiments on large-scale industry datasets. Surprisingly, our motivational experiments reveal that most intermediate layers of LLMs are redundant, indicating that pruning the remaining layers can still maintain strong performance. Motivated by this insight, we empower small language models for SR, namely SLMRec, which adopt a simple yet effective knowledge distillation method. Moreover, SLMRec is orthogonal to other post-training efficiency techniques, such as quantization and pruning, so that they can be leveraged in combination. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed SLMRec model attains the best performance using only 13% of the parameters found in LLM-based recommendation models while simultaneously achieving up to 6.6x and 8.0x speedups in training and inference time costs, respectively. Besides, we provide a theoretical justification for why small language models can perform comparably to large language models in SR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose PrefixQuant, a novel quantization method that achieves state-of-the-art performance across various precision levels (W4A4KV4 and W4A8KV4) and granularities (dynamic and static quantization) by effectively isolating token-wise outliers. First, PrefixQuant eliminates token-wise outliers by prefixing outlier tokens in the KV cache, a process that is training-free and highly efficient (e.g., 1 minutes for Llama-3-70B). Second, PrefixQuant introduces new trainable parameters for block-wise training to compensate for quantization error. Our experiments show that PrefixQuant significantly outperforms existing dynamic quantization methods, even under coarser static quantization settings. For instance, PrefixQuant achieves an average accuracy improvement of +3.08 and +2.85 points over SpinQuant (dynamic quantization) on five zero-shot reasoning tasks under dynamic and static quantization settings, respectively, on W4A4KV4 Llama-3-8B. Additionally, we demonstrate up to 2.74x prefilling speedup and 2.16x decoding speedup for LLMs using W4A4 PrefixQuant.

Among the various XAI techniques proposed in the literature, counterfactual explanations stand out as one of the most promising approaches. However, these "what-if" explanations are frequently complex and technical, making them difficult for non-experts to understand and, more broadly, challenging for humans to interpret. To bridge this gap, in this work, we exploit the power of open-source Large Language Models to generate natural language explanations when prompted with valid counterfactual instances produced by state-of-the-art explainers for graph-based models. Experiments across several graph datasets and counterfactual explainers show that our approach effectively produces accurate natural language representations of counterfactual instances, as demonstrated by key performance metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Softplus Attention with Re-weighting Boosts Length Extrapolation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13428v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved remarkable success in recent years, primarily due to the implementation of self-attention mechanisms. However, traditional Softmax attention suffers from numerical instability and reduced performance as the length of inference tokens increases. This paper addresses these issues by decomposing the Softmax operation into a non-linear transformation and the $l_1$-norm. We identify the latter as essential for maintaining model performance. By replacing the non-linear transformation with the Softplus activation function and introducing a dynamic scale factor for different token lengths based on invariance entropy, we create a novel attention mechanism with performance better than conventional Softmax attention across various inference lengths. To further improve the length extrapolation ability of the proposed attention mechanism, we introduce a fine-tuning-free re-weighting mechanism that amplifies significant attention weights while diminishing weaker ones, enabling the model to concentrate more effectively on relevant tokens without requiring retraining. When combined with our proposed attention mechanism, this approach demonstrates significant promise in managing longer sequences, maintaining nearly constant validation loss even at 16$\times$ the training token length while ensuring numerical stability.

However, ill-conditioned objectives and non-smooth regularizers undermine the performance of traditional stochastic gradient methods, leading to slow convergence and significant computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the $\texttt{SAPPHIRE}$ ($\textbf{S}$ketching-based $\textbf{A}$pproximations for $\textbf{P}$roximal $\textbf{P}$reconditioning and $\textbf{H}$essian $\textbf{I}$nexactness with Variance-$\textbf{RE}$educed Gradients) algorithm, which integrates sketch-based preconditioning to tackle ill-conditioning and uses a scaled proximal mapping to minimize the non-smooth regularizer. This stochastic variance-reduced algorithm achieves condition-number-free linear convergence to the optimum, delivering an efficient and scalable solution for ill-conditioned composite large-scale convex machine learning problems. Extensive experiments on lasso and logistic regression demonstrate that $\texttt{SAPPHIRE}$ often converges $20$ times faster than other common choices such as $\texttt{Catalyst}$, $\texttt{SAGA}$, and $\texttt{SVRG}$. This advantage persists even when the objective is non-convex or the preconditioner is infrequently updated, highlighting its robust and practical effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The current largest quantum computers feature more than one thousand qubits, challenging their classical simulators. State-vector quantum simulators are challenged by the exponential increase of representable quantum states with respect to the number of qubits, making more than fifty qubits practically unfeasible. A more appealing approach for simulating quantum computers is adopting the tensor network approach, whose memory requirements fundamentally depend on the level of entanglement in the quantum circuit, and allows simulating the current largest quantum computers. This work investigates and evaluates the CUDA-Q tensor network simulators on an Nvidia Grace Hopper system, particularly the Matrix Product State (MPS) formulation. We compare the performance of the CUDA-Q state vector implementation and validate the correctness of MPS simulations. Our results highlight that tensor network-based methods provide a significant opportunity to simulate large-qubit circuits, albeit approximately. We also show that current GPU-accelerated computation cannot fully utilize GPU efficiently in the case of MPS simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 33rd Euromicro International Conference on Parallel, Distributed and Network-Based Processing (PDP 2025)</p></details> |

Noise-robust loss functions have emerged as a notable strategy to counteract this issue, but it remains challenging to create a robust loss function which is not susceptible to underfitting. Through a quantitative approach, this paper explores the limited overlap between the network output at initialization and regions of non-vanishing gradients of bounded loss functions in the initial learning phase. Using these insights, we address underfitting of several noise robust losses with a novel method denoted as logit bias, which adds a real number $\epsilon$ to the logit at the position of the correct class. The logit bias enables these losses to achieve state-of-the-art results, even on datasets like WebVision, consisting of over a million images from 1000 classes. In addition, we demonstrate that our method can be used to determine optimal parameters for several loss functions -- without having to train networks. Remarkably, our method determines the hyperparameters based on the number of classes, resulting in loss functions which require zero dataset or noise-dependent parameters.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

However, current models fall short of capturing the spontaneity and variability inherent in real-world human speech, due to their reliance on audiobook datasets limited to formal read-aloud speech styles. To bridge this gap, we introduce Emilia-Pipe, an open-source preprocessing pipeline to extract high-quality training data from valuable yet underexplored in-the-wild data that capture spontaneous human speech in real-world contexts. By leveraging Emilia-Pipe, we construct Emilia, the first multilingual speech generation dataset derived from in-the-wild speech data. This dataset comprises over 101k hours of speech across six languages: English, Chinese, German, French, Japanese, and Korean. Besides, we expand Emilia to Emilia-Large, a dataset exceeding 216k hours, making it the largest open-source speech generation dataset available. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Emilia significantly outperforms traditional audiobook datasets in generating spontaneous and human-like speech, showcasing superior performance in capturing diverse speaker timbre and speaking styles of real-world human speech. Furthermore, this work underscores the importance of scaling dataset size to advance speech generation research and validates the effectiveness of Emilia for both multilingual and crosslingual speech generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of arXiv:2407.05361, submitted to TASLP, dataset is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/amphion/Emilia-Dataset</p></details> |

A proposed solution is the integration of external knowledge bases, such as knowledge graphs, with LLMs. Most existing methods use a paradigm that treats the question as the objective, with relevant knowledge being incrementally retrieved from the knowledge graph. However, this strategy frequently experiences an mismatch in the granularity of knowledge between the target question and the entities and relations being retrieved. As a result, the information in the question cannot precisely correspond to the retrieved knowledge. This may cause redundant exploration or omission of vital knowledge, thereby leading to enhanced computational consumption and reduced retrieval accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm of fine-grained stateful knowledge exploration, which addresses the `information granularity mismatch' issue. We extract fine-grained information from questions and explore the semantic mapping between this information and the knowledge in graph. By dynamically updating the mapping records, we avoid redundant exploration and ensure no pertinent information is overlooked, thereby reducing computational overhead and improving the accuracy of knowledge exploration. The use of fine-grained information also eliminates the need for a priori knowledge, a common requirement in existing methods. Experiments on multiple datasets revealed that our paradigm surpasses current advanced methods in knowledge retrieval while significantly reducing the average number of LLM invocations.</p></details> |  |

Advanced methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants, are found to enhance their reasoning skills by designing suitable prompts or breaking down complex problems into more manageable sub-problems. However, little concentration has been put on exploring the reasoning process, \textit{i.e.}, we discovered that most methods resort to Direct Reasoning (DR) and disregard Indirect Reasoning (IR). This can make LLMs difficult to solve IR tasks, which are often encountered in the real world. To address this issue, we propose a Direct-Indirect Reasoning (DIR) method, which considers DR and IR as multiple parallel reasoning paths that are merged to derive the final answer. We stimulate LLMs to implement IR by crafting prompt templates incorporating the principles of contrapositive and contradiction. These templates trigger LLMs to assume the negation of the conclusion as true, combine it with the premises to deduce a conclusion, and utilize the logical equivalence of the contrapositive to enhance their comprehension of the rules used in the reasoning process. Our DIR method is simple yet effective and can be straightforwardly integrated with existing variants of CoT methods. Experimental results on four datasets related to logical reasoning and mathematic proof demonstrate that our DIR method, when combined with various baseline methods, significantly outperforms all the original methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by COLING 2025 conference</p></details> |

In these attacks, malicious instructions embedded within external content can manipulate LLM outputs, causing deviations from user expectations. To address this critical yet under-explored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to assess the risk of such vulnerabilities. Using BIPIA, we evaluate existing LLMs and find them universally vulnerable. Our analysis identifies two key factors contributing to their success: LLMs' inability to distinguish between informational context and actionable instructions, and their lack of awareness in avoiding the execution of instructions within external content. Based on these findings, we propose two novel defense mechanisms-boundary awareness and explicit reminder-to address these vulnerabilities in both black-box and white-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our black-box defense provides substantial mitigation, while our white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels, all while preserving the output quality of LLMs. We hope this work inspires further research into securing LLM applications and fostering their safe and reliable use.</p></details> | Accepted by KDD 2025 |

To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS.

Conventional training approaches often struggle with data distribution imbalances and inadequacies in objective functions that do not align well with task-specific performance. To address these challenges, we introduce CycleQD, a novel approach that leverages the Quality Diversity framework through a cyclic adaptation of the algorithm, along with a model merging based crossover and an SVD-based mutation. In CycleQD, each task's performance metric is alternated as the quality measure while the others serve as the behavioral characteristics. This cyclic focus on individual tasks allows for concentrated effort on one task at a time, eliminating the need for data ratio tuning and simplifying the design of the objective function. Empirical results from AgentBench indicate that applying CycleQD to LLAMA3-8B-INSTRUCT based models not only enables them to surpass traditional fine-tuning methods in coding, operating systems, and database tasks, but also achieves performance on par with GPT-3.5-TURBO, which potentially contains much more parameters, across these domains. Crucially, this enhanced performance is achieved while retaining robust language capabilities, as evidenced by its performance on widely adopted language benchmark tasks. We highlight the key design choices in CycleQD, detailing how these contribute to its effectiveness. Furthermore, our method is general and can be applied to image segmentation models, highlighting its applicability across different domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Traditional industrial anomaly detection (IAD) models often struggle with flexibility and adaptability, especially in dynamic production environments where new defect types and operational changes frequently arise. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for overcoming these limitations by combining visual and textual information processing capabilities. MLLMs excel in general visual understanding due to their training on large, diverse datasets, but they lack domain-specific knowledge, such as industry-specific defect tolerance levels, which limits their effectiveness in IAD tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Echo, a novel multi-expert framework designed to enhance MLLM performance for IAD. Echo integrates four expert modules: Reference Extractor which provides a contextual baseline by retrieving similar normal images, Knowledge Guide which supplies domain-specific insights, Reasoning Expert which enables structured, stepwise reasoning for complex queries, and Decision Maker which synthesizes information from all modules to deliver precise, context-aware responses. Evaluated on the MMAD benchmark, Echo demonstrates significant improvements in adaptability, precision, and robustness, moving closer to meeting the demands of real-world industrial anomaly detection.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02803v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recommendation of medication is a vital aspect of intelligent healthcare systems, as it involves prescribing the most suitable drugs based on a patient's specific health needs. Unfortunately, many sophisticated models currently in use tend to overlook the nuanced semantics of medical data, while only relying heavily on identities. Furthermore, these models face significant challenges in handling cases involving patients who are visiting the hospital for the first time, as they lack prior prescription histories to draw upon. To tackle these issues, we harness the powerful semantic comprehension and input-agnostic characteristics of Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research aims to transform existing medication recommendation methodologies using LLMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Large Language Model Distilling Medication Recommendation (LEADER). We begin by creating appropriate prompt templates that enable LLMs to suggest medications effectively. However, the straightforward integration of LLMs into recommender systems leads to an out-of-corpus issue specific to drugs. We handle it by adapting the LLMs with a novel output layer and a refined tuning loss function. Although LLM-based models exhibit remarkable capabilities, they are plagued by high computational costs during inference, which is impractical for the healthcare sector. To mitigate this, we have developed a feature-level knowledge distillation technique, which transfers the LLM's proficiency to a more compact model. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrate that our proposed model not only delivers effective results but also is efficient. To ease the reproducibility of our experiments, we release the implementation code online.</p></details> |  |

Then we summarize related Healthcare training data, training methods, optimization strategies, and usage. Finally, the unique concerns associated with deploying LLMs in Healthcare settings are investigated, particularly regarding fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics. Our survey provide a comprehensive investigation from perspectives of both computer science and Healthcare specialty. Besides the discussion about Healthcare concerns, we supports the computer science community by compiling a collection of open source resources, such as accessible datasets, the latest methodologies, code implementations, and evaluation benchmarks in the Github. Summarily, we contend that a significant paradigm shift is underway, transitioning from PLMs to LLMs. This shift encompasses a move from discriminative AI approaches to generative AI approaches, as well as a shift from model-centered methodologies to data-centered methodologies. Also, we determine that the biggest obstacle of using LLMs in Healthcare are fairness, accountability, transparency and ethics.</p></details> |  |

DeepFlow addresses key challenges such as resource allocation, serving efficiency, and cold start latencies through four main design components. First, it uses a simple serverless abstraction called the request-job-task model, which helps manage AI workloads across post-training and model serving tasks. Second, it builds an in-house serving engine FlowServe using a microkernel-inspired design, NPU-centric execution, and SPMD-based parallelism to optimize LLM serving. The system also includes novel scheduling policies tailored for both PD-disaggregated and PD-colocated configurations. With optimizations like pre-warmed pods, DRAM pre-loading, and NPU-fork, DeepFlow can scale up to 64 instances in seconds. DeepFlow has been in production for over a year, operating on a large Ascend NPU cluster and providing industrystandard APIs for fine-tuning, agent serving, and model serving to our customers.</p></details> |  |

These approaches have recently been adapted to earth observation data, but they are only able to handle single image inputs, limiting their use for many real-world tasks. In this work, we develop a new vision and language assistant called TEOChat that can engage in conversations about temporal sequences of earth observation data. To train TEOChat, we curate an instruction-following dataset composed of many single image and temporal tasks including building change and damage assessment, semantic change detection, and temporal scene classification. We show that TEOChat can perform a wide variety of spatial and temporal reasoning tasks, substantially outperforming previous vision and language assistants, and even achieving comparable or better performance than several specialist models trained to perform specific tasks. Furthermore, TEOChat achieves impressive zero-shot performance on a change detection and change question answering dataset, outperforms GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro on multiple temporal tasks, and exhibits stronger single image capabilities than a comparable single image instruction-following model on scene classification, visual question answering, and captioning. We publicly release our data, model, and code at https://github.com/ermongroup/TEOChat .</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

The majority of the population in the United States doesn't have the right amount of health literacy to make the best use of that information. Health literacy means the ability to obtain and comprehend the basic health information to make appropriate health decisions. To build the bridge between this gap, organizations advocate adapting this medical knowledge into plain language. Building robust systems to automate the adaptations helps both medical and non-medical professionals best leverage the available information online. The goal of the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts (PLABA) track is to adapt the biomedical abstracts in English language extracted from PubMed based on the questions asked in MedlinePlus for the general public using plain language at the sentence level. As part of this track, we leveraged the best open-source Large Language Models suitable and fine-tuned for dialog use cases. We compare and present the results for all of our systems and our ranking among the other participants' submissions. Our top performing GPT-4 based model ranked first in the avg. simplicity measure and 3rd on the avg. accuracy measure.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

These challenges often lead to inefficiencies in memory utilization, latency, and throughput, hindering the effective deployment of LLMs, especially for non-experts. Through extensive experiments, we identify key performance bottlenecks, including sudden drops in memory utilization, latency fluctuations with varying batch sizes, and inefficiencies in multi-GPU configurations. These insights reveal a vast optimization space shaped by the intricate interplay of hardware, frameworks, and workload parameters. This underscores the need for a systematic approach to optimize LLM inference, motivating the design of our framework, GUIDE. GUIDE leverages dynamic modeling and simulation-based optimization to address these issues, achieving prediction errors between 9.9% and 42.3% for key metrics such as batch latency, TTFT, and decode throughput. By effectively bridging the gap between theoretical performance and practical deployment, our framework empowers practitioners, particularly non-specialists, to make data-driven decisions and unlock the full potential of LLMs in heterogeneous environments cheaply.</p></details> |  |

Math Word Problems (MWPs) serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating LLMs' reasoning abilities. While most research primarily focuses on improving accuracy, it often neglects understanding and addressing the underlying patterns of errors. Current error classification methods rely on static and predefined categories, which limit their ability to capture the full spectrum of error patterns in mathematical reasoning. To enable systematic error analysis, we collect error samples from 15 different LLMs of varying sizes across four distinct MWP datasets using multiple sampling strategies. Based on this extensive collection, we introduce MWPES-300K, a comprehensive dataset containing 304,865 error samples that cover diverse error patterns and reasoning paths. To reduce human bias and enable fine-grained analysis of error patterns, we propose a novel framework for automated dynamic error classification in mathematical reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that dataset characteristics significantly shape error patterns, which evolve from basic to complex manifestations as model capabilities increase. With deeper insights into error patterns, we propose error-aware prompting that incorporates common error patterns as explicit guidance, leading to significant improvements in mathematical reasoning performance.</p></details> | 22 pages, 9 figures |

Existing methods often struggle with cultural bias, limited scalability, and alignment between textual prompts and generated visuals, particularly under weak supervision. In this work, we propose a novel framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to address these challenges. Our method leverages LLMs for semantic refinement of textual prompts and introduces a weak supervision filtering module to effectively utilize noisy or weakly labeled data. By fine-tuning the LDM on an enhanced DeepFashion+ dataset enriched with global fashion styles, the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and higher Inception Scores (IS), while human evaluations confirm its ability to generate culturally diverse and semantically relevant fashion content. These results highlight the potential of LLM-guided diffusion models in driving scalable and inclusive AI-driven fashion innovation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on distinguishing fully watermarked text from non-watermarked text, overlooking real-world scenarios where LLMs generate only small sections within large documents. In this scenario, balancing time complexity and detection performance poses significant challenges. This paper presents WaterSeeker, a novel approach to efficiently detect and locate watermarked segments amid extensive natural text. It first applies an efficient anomaly extraction method to preliminarily locate suspicious watermarked regions. Following this, it conducts a local traversal and performs full-text detection for more precise verification. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WaterSeeker achieves a superior balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, its localization capability lays the foundation for building interpretable AI detection systems.

We used the US and South Korea as the cultural pair, given that prior research suggests substantial personality differences between people from these two countries. We manipulated the target of the simulation (US vs. Korean), the language of the inventory (English vs. Korean), and the language model (GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5). Our results show that GPT-4 replicated the cross-cultural differences for each factor. However, mean ratings had an upward bias and exhibited lower variation than in the human samples, as well as lower structural validity. We provide preliminary evidence that LLMs can aid cross-cultural researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages: 12 pages of manuscript + 15 pages of supplementary materials; in V3 added information that this is the Author Accepted Manuscript version</p></details> |

Existing watermarking techniques, such as \kgw, still face limitations under low watermark strength, stringent false-positive requirements, and low-entropy scenarios. Our analysis reveals that current detection methods rely on coarse estimates of non-watermarked text, which constrains watermark detectability. We propose the Bipolar Watermark (BiMarker), a novel approach that divides generated text into positive and negative poles, leveraging the difference in green token counts for detection. This differential mechanism significantly enhances the detectability of watermarked text. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate BiMarker's effectiveness and compatibility with existing optimization techniques, offering a new optimization dimension for watermarking in LLM-generated content.</p></details> |  |
| **[BitStack: Any-Size Compression of Large Language Models in Variable Memory Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23918v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized numerous applications, yet their deployment remains challenged by memory constraints on local devices. While scaling laws have enhanced LLM capabilities, the primary bottleneck has shifted from \textit{capability} to \textit{availability}, emphasizing the need for efficient memory management. Traditional compression methods, such as quantization, often require predefined compression ratios and separate compression processes for each setting, complicating deployment in variable memory environments. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{BitStack}, a novel, training-free weight compression approach that enables megabyte-level trade-offs between memory usage and model performance. By leveraging weight decomposition, BitStack can dynamically adjust the model size with minimal transmission between running memory and storage devices. Our approach iteratively decomposes weight matrices while considering the significance of each parameter, resulting in an approximately 1-bit per parameter residual block in each decomposition iteration. These blocks are sorted and stacked in storage as basic transmission units, with different quantities loaded based on current memory availability. Extensive experiments across a wide range of tasks demonstrate that, despite offering fine-grained size control, BitStack consistently matches or surpasses strong quantization baselines, particularly at extreme compression ratios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first decomposition-based method that effectively bridges the gap to practical compression techniques like quantization. Code is available at https://github.com/xinghaow99/BitStack.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Given that most KGs reside in graph databases accessible solely through specialized query languages (e.g., Cypher), it is critical to connect LLMs with KG databases by automating the translation of natural language into Cypher queries (termed as "Text2Cypher" task). Prior efforts tried to bolster LLMs' proficiency in Cypher generation through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, these explorations are hindered by the lack of annotated datasets of Query-Cypher pairs, resulting from the labor-intensive and domain-specific nature of such annotation. In this study, we propose SyntheT2C, a methodology for constructing a synthetic Query-Cypher pair dataset, comprising two distinct pipelines: (1) LLM-based prompting and (2) template-filling. SyntheT2C is applied to two medical KG databases, culminating in the creation of a synthetic dataset, MedT2C. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the MedT2C dataset effectively enhances the performance of backbone LLMs on Text2Cypher task via SFT. Both the SyntheT2C codebase and the MedT2C dataset are released in https://github.com/ZGChung/SyntheT2C.</p></details> | <details><summary>COLIN...</summary><p>COLING 2025 paper. 21 pages, 15 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This study explores a large-scale data synthesis approach to equip LLMs with character generalization capabilities. We begin by synthesizing large-scale character profiles using personas from Persona Hub and then explore two strategies: response rewriting and response generation, to create character-aligned instructional responses. To validate the effectiveness of our synthetic instruction tuning data for character generalization, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using the LLaMA-3 8B model. Our best-performing model strengthens the original LLaMA-3 8B Instruct model and achieves performance comparable to GPT-4o models on role-playing dialogue. We release our synthetic characters and instruction-tuning dialogues to support public research.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we aim to thoroughly examine the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist professional psychotherapy. To this end, we propose a new benchmark, CBT-BENCH, for the systematic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) assistance. We include three levels of tasks in CBT-BENCH: I: Basic CBT knowledge acquisition, with the task of multiple-choice questions; II: Cognitive model understanding, with the tasks of cognitive distortion classification, primary core belief classification, and fine-grained core belief classification; III: Therapeutic response generation, with the task of generating responses to patient speech in CBT therapy sessions. These tasks encompass key aspects of CBT that could potentially be enhanced through AI assistance, while also outlining a hierarchy of capability requirements, ranging from basic knowledge recitation to engaging in real therapeutic conversations. We evaluated representative LLMs on our benchmark. Experimental results indicate that while LLMs perform well in reciting CBT knowledge, they fall short in complex real-world scenarios requiring deep analysis of patients' cognitive structures and generating effective responses, suggesting potential future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Despite the significant advancements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capability in string processing remains underexplored and underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs' string processing capability. In particular, we first propose StringLLM, a method to construct datasets for benchmarking string processing capability of LLMs. We use StringLLM to build a series of datasets, referred to as StringBench. It encompasses a wide range of string processing tasks, allowing us to systematically evaluate LLMs' performance in this area. Our evaluations indicate that LLMs struggle with accurately processing strings compared to humans. To uncover the underlying reasons for this limitation, we conduct an in-depth analysis and subsequently propose an effective approach that significantly enhances LLMs' string processing capability via fine-tuning. This work provides a foundation for future research to understand LLMs' string processing capability.

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential solutions, yet high costs and ethical concerns about training data remain challenges. This paper introduces a pipeline for synthesizing clinical interviews, resulting in 1,157 interactive dialogues (PsyInterview), and presents EmoScan, an LLM-based emotional disorder screening system. EmoScan distinguishes between coarse (e.g., anxiety or depressive disorders) and fine disorders (e.g., major depressive disorders) and conducts high-quality interviews. Evaluations showed that EmoScan exceeded the performance of base models and other LLMs like GPT-4 in screening emotional disorders (F1-score=0.7467). It also delivers superior explanations (BERTScore=0.9408) and demonstrates robust generalizability (F1-score of 0.67 on an external dataset). Furthermore, EmoScan outperforms baselines in interviewing skills, as validated by automated ratings and human evaluations. This work highlights the importance of scalable data-generative pipelines for developing effective mental health LLM tools.</p></details> |  |

However, scientific data often exists in both visual and textual modalities. Vision language models (VLMs) address this by incorporating a pretrained vision backbone for processing images and a cross-modal projector that adapts image tokens into the LLM dimensional space, thereby providing richer multimodal comprehension. Nevertheless, off-the-shelf VLMs show limited capabilities in handling domain-specific data and are prone to hallucinations. We developed intelligent assistants finetuned from LLaVA models to enhance multimodal understanding in low-dose radiation therapy (LDRT)-a benign approach used in the treatment of cancer-related illnesses. Using multilingual data from 42,673 articles, we devise complex reasoning and detailed description tasks for visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks. Our assistants, trained on 50,882 image-text pairs, demonstrate superior performance over base models as evaluated using LLM-as-a-judge approach, particularly in reducing hallucination and improving domain-specific comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 Pag...</summary><p>4 Pages, 4 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA offer computationally efficient adaptations of these models, their practical deployment often assumes centralized data and training environments. However, real-world scenarios frequently involve distributed, privacy-sensitive datasets that require decentralized solutions. Federated learning (FL) addresses data privacy by coordinating model updates across clients, but it is typically based on centralized aggregation through a parameter server, which can introduce bottlenecks and communication constraints. Decentralized learning, in contrast, eliminates this dependency by enabling direct collaboration between clients, improving scalability and efficiency in distributed environments. Despite its advantages, decentralized LLM fine-tuning remains underexplored. In this work, we propose \texttt{Dec-LoRA}, an algorithm for decentralized fine-tuning of LLMs based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Through extensive experiments on BERT and LLaMA-2 models, we evaluate \texttt{Dec-LoRA}'s performance in handling data heterogeneity and quantization constraints, enabling scalable, privacy-preserving LLM fine-tuning in decentralized settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Turbulence: Systematically and Automatically Testing Instruction-Tuned Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14856v3)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for systematically evaluating the correctness and robustness of instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) for code generation via a new benchmark, Turbulence. Turbulence consists of a large set of natural language $\textit{question templates}$, each of which is a programming problem, parameterised so that it can be asked in many different forms. Each question template has an associated $\textit{test oracle}$ that judges whether a code solution returned by an LLM is correct. Thus, from a single question template, it is possible to ask an LLM a $\textit{neighbourhood}$ of very similar programming questions, and assess the correctness of the result returned for each question. This allows gaps in an LLM's code generation abilities to be identified, including $\textit{anomalies}$ where the LLM correctly solves $\textit{almost all}$ questions in a neighbourhood but fails for particular parameter instantiations. We present experiments against five LLMs from OpenAI, Cohere and Meta, each at two temperature configurations. Our findings show that, across the board, Turbulence is able to reveal gaps in LLM reasoning ability. This goes beyond merely highlighting that LLMs sometimes produce wrong code (which is no surprise): by systematically identifying cases where LLMs are able to solve some problems in a neighbourhood but do not manage to generalise to solve the whole neighbourhood, our method is effective at highlighting $\textit{robustness}$ issues. We present data and examples that shed light on the kinds of mistakes that LLMs make when they return incorrect code results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated to the ICST2025 conference version</p></details> |

The HumanEval Benchmark, developed by OpenAI, remains the most widely used code generation benchmark. However, this and other Code LLM benchmarks face critical limitations, particularly in task diversity, test coverage, and linguistic scope. Current evaluations primarily focus on English-to-Python conversion tasks with limited test cases, potentially overestimating model performance. While recent works have addressed test coverage and programming language (PL) diversity, code generation from low-resource language prompts remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce mHumanEval, an extended benchmark supporting prompts in over 200 natural languages. We employ established machine translation methods to compile the benchmark, coupled with a quality assurance process. Furthermore, we provide expert human translations for 15 diverse natural languages (NLs). We conclude by analyzing the multilingual code generation capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) Code LLMs, offering insights into the current landscape of cross-lingual code generation.</p></details> | 30 Pages |
| **[Large Language Models as Theory of Mind Aware Generative Agents with Counterfactual Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15355v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess significant theory of mind (ToM) capabilities, showing the potential for simulating the tracking of mental states in generative agents. In this study, we propose a novel paradigm called ToM-agent, designed to empower LLMs-based generative agents to simulate ToM in open-domain conversational interactions. ToM-agent disentangles the confidence from mental states, facilitating the emulation of an agent's perception of its counterpart's mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Using past conversation history and verbal reflections, ToM-Agent can dynamically adjust counterparts' inferred BDIs, along with related confidence levels. We further put forth a counterfactual intervention method that reflects on the gap between the predicted responses of counterparts and their real utterances, thereby enhancing the efficiency of reflection. Leveraging empathetic and persuasion dialogue datasets, we assess the advantages of implementing the ToM-agent with downstream tasks, as well as its performance in both the first-order and the \textit{second-order} ToM. Our findings indicate that the ToM-agent can grasp the underlying reasons for their counterpart's behaviors beyond mere semantic-emotional supporting or decision-making based on common sense, providing new insights for studying large-scale LLMs-based simulation of human social behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Distributed Optimization for Large-Scale Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12156v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) forms a crucial foundation in optimization, encompassing a broad spectrum of domains and serving as the basis for more advanced algorithms. Consequently, as the scale and complexity of modern applications continue to grow, the development of efficient and reliable QP algorithms is becoming increasingly vital. In this context, this paper introduces a novel deep learning-aided distributed optimization architecture designed for tackling large-scale QP problems. First, we combine the state-of-the-art Operator Splitting QP (OSQP) method with a consensus approach to derive DistributedQP, a new method tailored for network-structured problems, with convergence guarantees to optimality. Subsequently, we unfold this optimizer into a deep learning framework, leading to DeepDistributedQP, which leverages learned policies to accelerate reaching to desired accuracy within a restricted amount of iterations. Our approach is also theoretically grounded through Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory, providing generalization bounds on the expected optimality gap for unseen problems. The proposed framework, as well as its centralized version DeepQP, significantly outperform their standard optimization counterparts on a variety of tasks such as randomly generated problems, optimal control, linear regression, transportation networks and others. Notably, DeepDistributedQP demonstrates strong generalization by training on small problems and scaling to solve much larger ones (up to 50K variables and 150K constraints) using the same policy. Moreover, it achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements in wall-clock time compared to OSQP. The certifiable performance guarantees of our approach are also demonstrated, ensuring higher-quality solutions over traditional optimizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[On The Truthfulness of 'Surprisingly Likely' Responses of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07692v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The principle of rewarding a crowd for surprisingly common answers has been used in the literature for designing a number of truthful information elicitation mechanisms. A related method has also been proposed in the literature for better aggregation of crowd wisdom. Drawing a comparison between crowd based collective intelligence systems and large language models, we define the notion of 'surprisingly likely' textual response of a large language model. This notion is inspired by the surprisingly common principle, but tailored for text in a language model. Using benchmarks such as TruthfulQA and openly available LLMs: GPT-2 and LLaMA-2, we show that the surprisingly likely textual responses of large language models are more accurate in many cases compared to standard baselines. For example, we observe up to 24 percentage points aggregate improvement on TruthfulQA and up to 70 percentage points improvement on individual categories of questions in this benchmark. We also provide further analysis of the results, including the cases when surprisingly likely responses are less or not more accurate.</p></details> |  |

However, their huge computational and memory costs raise significant challenges in deploying these models on resource-constrained devices or efficiently serving them. Prior approaches have attempted to alleviate these problems by permanently removing less important model structures, yet these methods often result in substantial performance degradation due to the permanent deletion of model parameters. In this work, we tried to mitigate this issue by reducing the number of active parameters without permanently removing them. Specifically, we introduce a differentiable dynamic pruning method that pushes dense models to maintain a fixed number of active parameters by converting their MLP layers into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Our method, even without fine-tuning, consistently outperforms previous structural pruning techniques across diverse model families, including Phi-2, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen-2.5.</p></details> |  |

To ease this issue, we propose PIP (Perturbation-based Iterative Pruning), a novel double-view structured pruning method to optimize LLMs, which combines information from two different views: the unperturbed view and the perturbed view. With the calculation of gradient differences, PIP iteratively prunes those that struggle to distinguish between these two views. Our experiments show that PIP reduces the parameter count by approximately 20% while retaining over 85% of the original model's accuracy across varied benchmarks. In some cases, the performance of the pruned model is within 5% of the unpruned version, demonstrating PIP's ability to preserve key aspects of model effectiveness. Moreover, PIP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) structured pruning methods, establishing it as a leading technique for optimizing LLMs in environments with constrained resources.

| **[Reasoning AI Performance Degradation in 6G Networks with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17097v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) within 6G networks is poised to revolutionize connectivity, reliability, and intelligent decision-making. However, the performance of AI models in these networks is crucial, as any decline can significantly impact network efficiency and the services it supports. Understanding the root causes of performance degradation is essential for maintaining optimal network functionality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reason about AI model performance degradation in 6G networks using the Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. Our approach employs an LLM as a ''teacher'' model through zero-shot prompting to generate teaching CoT rationales, followed by a CoT ''student'' model that is fine-tuned by the generated teaching data for learning to reason about performance declines. The efficacy of this model is evaluated in a real-world scenario involving a real-time 3D rendering task with multi-Access Technologies (mATs) including WiFi, 5G, and LiFi for data transmission. Experimental results show that our approach achieves over 97% reasoning accuracy on the built test questions, confirming the validity of our collected dataset and the effectiveness of the LLM-CoT method. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing the reliability and efficiency of 6G networks, representing a significant advancement in the evolution of AI-native network infrastructures.</p></details> | IEEE WCNC 2025 |

Yet, these models are often plagued by the hallucination problem, which involves generating inaccurate objects, attributes, and relationships that do not match the visual content. In this work, we delve into the internal attention mechanisms of MLLMs to reveal the underlying causes of hallucination, exposing the inherent vulnerabilities in the instruction-tuning process. We propose a novel hallucination attack against MLLMs that exploits attention sink behaviors to trigger hallucinated content with minimal image-text relevance, posing a significant threat to critical downstream applications. Distinguished from previous adversarial methods that rely on fixed patterns, our approach generates dynamic, effective, and highly transferable visual adversarial inputs, without sacrificing the quality of model responses. Comprehensive experiments on 6 prominent MLLMs demonstrate the efficacy of our attack in compromising black-box MLLMs even with extensive mitigating mechanisms, as well as the promising results against cutting-edge commercial APIs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5.

However, according to the Cranfield paradigm and the research into publicly available datasets, the existing information retrieval research studies are commonly developed on small-scale datasets that rely on human assessors for relevance judgments - a time-intensive and expensive process. Recent studies have shown the strong capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in producing reliable relevance judgments with human accuracy but at a greatly reduced cost. In this paper, to address the missing large-scale ad-hoc document retrieval dataset, we extend the TREC Deep Learning Track (DL) test collection via additional language model synthetic labels to enable researchers to test and evaluate their search systems at a large scale. Specifically, such a test collection includes more than 1,900 test queries from the previous years of tracks. We compare system evaluation with past human labels from past years and find that our synthetically created large-scale test collection can lead to highly correlated system rankings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, resource paper, WWW 2025</p></details> |

However, their roles in enhancing model generalization capabilities remain unclear. This paper studies the difference between SFT and RL on generalization and memorization, focusing on text-based rule variants and visual variants. We introduce GeneralPoints, an arithmetic reasoning card game, and adopt V-IRL, a real-world navigation environment, to assess how models trained with SFT and RL generalize to unseen variants in both textual and visual domains. We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both rule-based textual and visual variants. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize out-of-distribution scenarios. Further analysis reveals that RL improves the model's underlying visual recognition capabilities, contributing to its enhanced generalization in the visual domain. Despite RL's superior generalization, we show that SFT remains essential for effective RL training; SFT stabilizes the model's output format, enabling subsequent RL to achieve its performance gains. These findings demonstrates the capability of RL for acquiring generalizable knowledge in complex, multi-modal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL</p></details> |

While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, accurately segmenting catheter and guidewire structures is challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data. Foundation models offer a promising solution by enabling the collection of similar domain data to train models whose weights can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Nonetheless, large-scale data collection for training is constrained by the necessity of maintaining patient privacy. This paper proposes a new method to train a foundation model in a decentralized federated learning setting for endovascular intervention. To ensure the feasibility of the training, we tackle the unseen data issue using differentiable Earth Mover's Distance within a knowledge distillation framework. Once trained, our foundation model's weights provide valuable initialization for downstream tasks, thereby enhancing task-specific performance. Intensive experiments show that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art results, contributing to advancements in endovascular intervention and robotic-assisted endovascular surgery, while addressing the critical issue of data sharing in the medical domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages.

Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoLLaMA 3: Frontier Multimodal Foundation Models for Image and Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13106v3)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose VideoLLaMA3, a more advanced multimodal foundation model for image and video understanding. The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of "vision-centric" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens. For video inputs, we reduce the number of vision tokens according to their similarity so that the representation of videos will be more precise and compact. Benefit from vision-centric designs, VideoLLaMA3 achieves compelling performances in both image and video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>BZ, K...</summary><p>BZ, KL, ZC, ZH, YY, GC, SL, YJ, HZ, and XL contributed equally to this project.

| **[Molecular-driven Foundation Model for Oncologic Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16652v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are reshaping computational pathology by enabling transfer learning, where models pre-trained on vast datasets can be adapted for downstream diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic response tasks. Despite these advances, foundation models are still limited in their ability to encode the entire gigapixel whole-slide images without additional training and often lack complementary multimodal data. Here, we introduce Threads, a slide-level foundation model capable of generating universal representations of whole-slide images of any size. Threads was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse cohort of 47,171 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue sections, paired with corresponding genomic and transcriptomic profiles - the largest such paired dataset to be used for foundation model development to date. This unique training paradigm enables Threads to capture the tissue's underlying molecular composition, yielding powerful representations applicable to a wide array of downstream tasks. In extensive benchmarking across 54 oncology tasks, including clinical subtyping, grading, mutation prediction, immunohistochemistry status determination, treatment response prediction, and survival prediction, Threads outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and label efficiency. It is particularly well suited for predicting rare events, further emphasizing its clinical utility. We intend to make the model publicly available for the broader community.</p></details> |  |

Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages including supplement. 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

When such base models are deprecated and replaced, all associated LoRA modules must be retrained, requiring access to either the original training data or a substantial amount of synthetic data that mirrors the original distribution. However, the original data is often inaccessible due to privacy or licensing issues, and generating synthetic data may be impractical and insufficiently representative. These factors complicate the fine-tuning process considerably. To address this challenge, we introduce a new adapter, Cross-Model Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-X), which enables the training-free transfer of LoRA parameters across source and target models, eliminating the need for original or synthetic training data. Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within the subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our prior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria for ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base model's weights and subspace. To facilitate the transfer of LoRA parameters of the source model to a target model, we employ the adapter only in the layers of the target model that exhibit an acceptable level of subspace similarity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-X for text-to-image generation, including Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Toxicity in Open Source Software Communications Using Psycholinguistics and Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13133v3)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies have shown that toxic behavior can cause contributors to leave, and hinder newcomers' (especially from underrepresented communities) participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Thus, detection of toxic language plays a crucial role in OSS collaboration and inclusivity. Off-the-shelf toxicity detectors are ineffective when applied to OSS communications, due to the distinct nature of toxicity observed in these channels (e.g., entitlement and arrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). In this paper, we investigate a machine learning-based approach for the automatic detection of toxic communications in OSS. We leverage psycholinguistic lexicons, and Moral Foundations Theory to analyze toxicity in two types of OSS communication channels; issue comments and code reviews. Our evaluation indicates that our approach can achieve a significant performance improvement (up to 7% increase in F1 score) over the existing domain-specific toxicity detector. We found that using moral values as features is more effective than linguistic cues, resulting in 67.50% F1-measure in identifying toxic instances in code review data and 64.83% in issue comments. While the detection accuracy is far from accurate, this improvement demonstrates the potential of integrating moral and psycholinguistic features in toxicity detection models. These findings highlight the importance of context-specific models that consider the unique communication styles within OSS, where interpersonal and value-driven language dynamics differ markedly from general social media platforms. Future work could focus on refining these models to further enhance detection accuracy, possibly by incorporating community-specific norms and conversational context to better capture the nuanced expressions of toxicity in OSS environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) models for medical literature mining has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation across broad therapeutic areas and diverse tasks. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model for study search, screening, and data extraction from medical literature. The model is trained on 633,759 instruction data points in LEADSInstruct, curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. We showed that LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge generic large language models (LLMs) on six tasks. Furthermore, LEADS enhances expert workflows by providing supportive references following expert requests, streamlining processes while maintaining high-quality results. A study with 16 clinicians and medical researchers from 14 different institutions revealed that experts collaborating with LEADS achieved a recall of 0.81 compared to 0.77 experts working alone in study selection, with a time savings of 22.6%. In data extraction tasks, experts using LEADS achieved an accuracy of 0.85 versus 0.80 without using LEADS, alongside a 26.9% time savings. These findings highlight the potential of specialized medical literature foundation models to outperform generic models, delivering significant quality and efficiency benefits when integrated into expert workflows for medical literature mining.</p></details> |  |

Morphing attack detection (MAD) systems aim to detect a specific type of threat, morphing attacks, at an early stage, preventing them from being considered for verification in critical processes. Foundation models (FM) learn from extensive amounts of unlabelled data, achieving remarkable zero-shot generalization to unseen domains. Although this generalization capacity might be weak when dealing with domain-specific downstream tasks such as MAD, FMs can easily adapt to these settings while retaining the built-in knowledge acquired during pre-training. In this work, we recognize the potential of FMs to perform well in the MAD task when properly adapted to its specificities. To this end, we adapt FM CLIP architectures with LoRA weights while simultaneously training a classification header. The proposed framework, MADation surpasses our alternative FM and transformer-based frameworks and constitutes the first adaption of FMs to the MAD task. MADation presents competitive results with current MAD solutions in the literature and even surpasses them in several evaluation scenarios. To encourage reproducibility and facilitate further research in MAD, we publicly release the implementation of MADation at https://github.com/gurayozgur/MADation</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025 workshops</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking the Bias of Foundation Model under Long-tailed Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15955v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Vision Foundation Models for Input Monitoring in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08083v2)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain challenged by distribution shifts in complex open-world domains like automated driving (AD): Absolute robustness against yet unknown novel objects (semantic shift) or styles like lighting conditions (covariate shift) cannot be guaranteed. Hence, reliable operation-time monitors for identification of out-of-training-data-distribution (OOD) scenarios are imperative. Current approaches for OOD classification are untested for complex domains like AD, are limited in the kinds of shifts they detect, or even require supervision with OOD samples. To prepare for unanticipated shifts, we instead establish a framework around a principled, unsupervised, and model-agnostic method that unifies detection of all kinds of shifts: Find a full model of the training data's feature distribution, to then use its density at new points as in-distribution (ID) score. To implement this, we propose to combine the newly available Vision Foundation Models (VFM) as feature extractors with one of four alternative density modeling techniques. In an extensive benchmark of 4 VFMs against 20 baselines, we show the superior performance of VFM feature encodings compared to shift-specific OOD monitors. Additionally, we find that sophisticated architectures outperform larger latent space dimensionality; and our method identifies samples with higher risk of errors on downstream tasks, despite being model-agnostic. This suggests that VFMs are promising to realize model-agnostic, unsupervised, reliable safety monitors in complex vision tasks.</p></details> |  |

These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |

However, their rapidly growing capabilities and autonomy have raised significant concerns about AI safety. Researchers are exploring better ways to design guardrails to ensure that the runtime behavior of FM-based agents remains within specific boundaries. Nevertheless, designing effective runtime guardrails is challenging due to the agents' autonomous and non-deterministic behavior. The involvement of multiple pipeline stages and agent artifacts, such as goals, plans, tools, at runtime further complicates these issues. Addressing these challenges at runtime requires multi-layered guardrails that operate effectively at various levels of the agent architecture. Therefore, in this paper, based on the results of a systematic literature review, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of runtime guardrails for FM-based agents to identify the key quality attributes for guardrails and design dimensions. Inspired by the Swiss Cheese Model, we also propose a reference architecture for designing multi-layered runtime guardrails for FM-based agents, which includes three dimensions: quality attributes, pipelines, and artifacts. The proposed taxonomy and reference architecture provide concrete and robust guidance for researchers and practitioners to build AI-safety-by-design from a software architecture perspective.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Rethinking Bradley-Terry Models in Preference-Based Reward Modeling: Foundations, Theory, and Alternatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04991v2)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bradley-Terry (BT) model is a common and successful practice in reward modeling for Large Language Model (LLM) alignment. However, it remains unclear why this model -- originally developed for multi-player stochastic game matching -- can be adopted to convert pairwise response comparisons to reward values and make predictions. Especially given the fact that only a limited number of prompt-response pairs are sparsely compared with others. In this paper, we first revisit the foundations of using BT models in reward modeling, and establish the convergence rate of BT reward models based on deep neural networks using embeddings, providing a theoretical foundation for their use. Despite theoretically sound, we argue that the BT model is not a necessary choice from the perspective of downstream optimization. This is because a reward model only needs to preserve the correct ranking predictions through a monotonic transformation of the true reward. We highlight the critical concept of order consistency in reward modeling and demonstrate that the BT model possesses this property. Consequently, we propose a simple and straightforward upper-bound algorithm, compatible with off-the-shelf binary classifiers, as an alternative order-consistent reward modeling objective. To offer practical insights, we empirically evaluate the performance of these different reward modeling approaches across more than 12,000 experimental setups, using $6$ base LLMs, $2$ datasets, and diverse annotation designs that vary in quantity, quality, and pairing choices in preference annotations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grid Monitoring with Synchro-Waveform and AI Foundation Model Technologies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942v2)** | 2025-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose:This article advocates for the development of a next-generation grid monitoring and control system designed for future grids dominated by inverter-based resources. Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages. Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed. Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</p></details> |  |

SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively.

Traditionally, visual data has been the primary source for object perception; however, it often proves insufficient in scenarios where visibility is obstructed or detailed observation is needed. This gap highlights the necessity of tactile sensing as a complementary or primary input for material recognition. Tactile data becomes particularly essential in contact-rich, small-scale manipulations where subtle deformations and surface interactions cannot be accurately captured by vision alone. This letter presents a novel approach leveraging a temporal binding foundation model for tactile sequence understanding to enhance material property recognition. By processing tactile sensor data with a temporal focus, the proposed system captures the sequential nature of tactile interactions, similar to human fingertip perception. Additionally, this letter demonstrates that, through tailored and specific design, the foundation model can more effectively capture temporal information embedded in tactile sequences, advancing material property understanding. Experimental results validate the model's capability to capture these temporal patterns, confirming its utility for material property recognition in visually restricted scenarios. This work underscores the necessity of embedding advanced tactile data processing frameworks within robotic systems to achieve truly embodied and responsive manipulation capabilities.</p></details> | 4 pages, |

Despite notable progress in recent years, current RVOS models remain struggle to handle complicated object descriptions due to their limited video-language understanding. To address this limitation, we present \textbf{ReferDINO}, an end-to-end RVOS model that inherits strong vision-language understanding from the pretrained visual grounding foundation models, and is further endowed with effective temporal understanding and object segmentation capabilities. In ReferDINO, we contribute three technical innovations for effectively adapting the foundation models to RVOS: 1) an object-consistent temporal enhancer that capitalizes on the pretrained object-text representations to enhance temporal understanding and object consistency; 2) a grounding-guided deformable mask decoder that integrates text and grounding conditions to generate accurate object masks; 3) a confidence-aware query pruning strategy that significantly improves the object decoding efficiency without compromising performance. We conduct extensive experiments on five public RVOS benchmarks to demonstrate that our proposed ReferDINO outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.

To address this, we introduce VL-DCOPs, a framework that takes advantage of large multimodal foundation models (LFMs) to automatically generate constraints from both visual and linguistic instructions. We then introduce a spectrum of agent archetypes for solving VL-DCOPs: from a neuro-symbolic agent that delegates some of the algorithmic decisions to an LFM, to a fully neural agent that depends entirely on an LFM for coordination. We evaluate these agent archetypes using state-of-the-art LLMs (large language models) and VLMs (vision language models) on three novel VL-DCOP tasks and compare their respective advantages and drawbacks. Lastly, we discuss how this work extends to broader frontier challenges in the DCOP literature.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large foundation model specifically developed for chemicals. ChemFM comprises 3 billion parameters and is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using either full-parameter or parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific AI models across all tested tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.80% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates its superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 2D CT Foundation Model for Contrast Phase Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14066v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: The purpose of this study is to harness the efficiency of a 2D foundation model to develop a robust phase classifier that is resilient to domain shifts. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study utilized three public datasets from separate institutions. A 2D foundation model was trained on the DeepLesion dataset (mean age: 51.2, s.d.: 17.6; 2398 males) to generate embeddings from 2D CT slices for downstream contrast phase classification. The classifier was trained on the VinDr Multiphase dataset and externally validated on the WAW-TACE dataset. The 2D model was also compared to three 3D supervised models. Results: On the VinDr dataset (146 male, 63 female, 56 unidentified), the model achieved near-perfect AUROC scores and F1 scores of 99.2%, 94.2%, and 93.1% for non-contrast, arterial, and venous phases, respectively. The `Other' category scored lower (F1: 73.4%) due to combining multiple contrast phases into one class. On the WAW-TACE dataset (mean age: 66.1, s.d.: 10.0; 185 males), the model showed strong performance with AUROCs of 91.0% and 85.6%, and F1 scores of 87.3% and 74.1% for non-contrast and arterial phases. Venous phase performance was lower, with AUROC and F1 scores of 81.7% and 70.2% respectively, due to label mismatches. Compared to 3D supervised models, the approach trained faster, performed as well or better, and showed greater robustness to domain shifts. Conclusion: The robustness of the 2D Foundation model may be potentially useful for automation of hanging protocols and data orchestration for clinical deployment of AI algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, common CLIP-based approaches need large amounts of samples and do not natively support 3D or tabular data, both of which are crucial in the medical domain. To address these issues, we revisit CLIP-style alignment by training a domain-specific 3D foundation model as an image encoder and demonstrate that modality alignment is feasible with only 62 MRI scans. Our approach is enabled by a simple embedding accumulation strategy required for training in 3D, which scales the amount of negative pairs across batches in order to stabilize training. We perform a thorough evaluation of various design choices, including the choice of backbone and loss functions, and evaluate the proposed methodology on zero-shot classification and image-retrieval tasks. While zero-shot image-retrieval remains challenging, zero-shot classification results demonstrate that the proposed approach can meaningfully align the representations of 3D MRI with tabular data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures.

This study introduces an evaluation framework for assessing the clinical impact and translatability of SAM, MedSAM, and SAM2, using musculoskeletal MRI as a case study. We tested these models across zero-shot and finetuned paradigms to assess their ability to process diverse anatomical structures and effectuate clinically reliable biomarkers, including cartilage thickness, muscle volume, and disc height. We engineered a modular pipeline emphasizing scalability, clinical relevance, and workflow integration, reducing manual effort and aligning validation with end-user expectations. Hierarchical modeling revealed how dataset mixing, anatomical complexity, and MRI acquisition parameters influence performance, providing insights into the role of imaging refinements in improving segmentation accuracy. This work demonstrates how clinically focused evaluations can connect computational advancements with tangible applications, creating a pathway for foundation models to address medical challenges. By emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration and aligning technical innovation with clinical priorities, our framework provides a roadmap for advancing machine learning technologies into scalable and impactful biomedical solutions.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training strategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary information from clinical data for medical foundation model development. MEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL) and adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature extractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and clinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was pre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices), breast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The experimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves cancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</p></details> |  |

One of the fundamental limitations of the top-performing SAR ATR methods is that the learning paradigm is supervised, task-specific, limited-category, closed-world learning, which depends on massive amounts of accurately annotated samples that are expensively labeled by expert SAR analysts and have limited generalization capability and scalability. In this work, we make the first attempt towards building a foundation model for SAR ATR, termed SARATR-X. SARATR-X learns generalizable representations via self-supervised learning (SSL) and provides a cornerstone for label-efficient model adaptation to generic SAR target detection and classification tasks. Specifically, SARATR-X is trained on 0.18 M unlabelled SAR target samples, which are curated by combining contemporary benchmarks and constitute the largest publicly available dataset till now. Considering the characteristics of SAR images, a backbone tailored for SAR ATR is carefully designed, and a two-step SSL method endowed with multi-scale gradient features was applied to ensure the feature diversity and model scalability of SARATR-X. The capabilities of SARATR-X are evaluated on classification under few-shot and robustness settings and detection across various categories and scenes, and impressive performance is achieved, often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised algorithms. Our SARATR-X and the curated dataset are released at https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARATR-X to foster research into foundation models for SAR image interpretation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

Previous work on GFMs focused on tailoring model architecture and pre-text tasks, and did not investigate the impact of pre-training data selection on model performance. However, recent works from other domains show that the pre-training data distribution is an important factor influencing the performance of the foundation models. With this motivation, our research explores how the geographic distribution of pre-training data affects the performance of GFMs. We evaluated several pre-training data distributions by sampling different compositions from a global data pool. Our experiments with two GFMs on downstream tasks indicate that balanced and globally representative data compositions often outperform region-specific sampling, highlighting the importance of diversity and global coverage in pre-training data. Our results suggest that the most appropriate data sampling technique may depend on the specific GFM architecture. These findings will support the development of robust GFMs by incorporating quality pre-training data distributions, ultimately improving machine learning solutions for Earth observation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Good Data for Generative AI @ AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, prostate ultrasound images lack pixel-level cancer annotations, introducing label noise. Current approaches often focus on limited regions of interest (ROIs), disregarding anatomical context necessary for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models can overcome this limitation by analyzing entire images to capture global spatial relationships; however, they still encounter challenges stemming from the weak labels associated with coarse pathology annotations in ultrasound data. We introduce Cinepro, a novel framework that strengthens foundation models' ability to localize PCa in ultrasound cineloops. Cinepro adapts robust training by integrating the proportion of cancer tissue reported by pathology in a biopsy core into its loss function to address label noise, providing a more nuanced supervision. Additionally, it leverages temporal data across multiple frames to apply robust augmentations, enhancing the model's ability to learn stable cancer-related features. Cinepro demonstrates superior performance on a multi-center prostate ultrasound dataset, achieving an AUROC of 77.1% and a balanced accuracy of 83.8%, surpassing current benchmarks. These findings underscore Cinepro's promise in advancing foundation models for weakly labeled ultrasound data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to IEEE ISBI 2025</p></details> |

Foundation models, pre-trained on diverse datasets, can be applied in a zero-shot setting with minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare Google's TimesFM model to conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH and Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), using 19 years of daily returns from the S&P 100 index and its constituents. Backtesting with over 8.5 years of out-of-sample data shows that the fine-tuned foundation model consistently outperforms traditional methods in actual-over-expected ratios. For the quantile score loss function, it performs comparably to the best econometric model, GAS. Overall, the foundation model ranks as the best or among the top performers across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 quantile forecasting. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, showing that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR.</p></details> |  |

This trend is particularly driven by the complexity of modern AI models and their decision-making processes. The advent of foundation models, characterized by their extensive generalization capabilities and emergent uses, has further complicated this landscape. Foundation models occupy an ambiguous position in the explainability domain: their complexity makes them inherently challenging to interpret, yet they are increasingly leveraged as tools to construct explainable models. In this survey, we explore the intersection of foundation models and eXplainable AI (XAI) in the vision domain. We begin by compiling a comprehensive corpus of papers that bridge these fields. Next, we categorize these works based on their architectural characteristics. We then discuss the challenges faced by current research in integrating XAI within foundation models. Furthermore, we review common evaluation methodologies for these combined approaches. Finally, we present key observations and insights from our survey, offering directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> |  |

However, its comparative performance with traditional deep learning (DL) models remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to evaluate RETFound against three ImageNet-pretrained supervised DL models (ResNet50, ViT-base, SwinV2) in detecting ocular and systemic diseases. Methods: We fine-tuned/trained RETFound and three DL models on full datasets, 50%, 20%, and fixed sample sizes (400, 200, 100 images, with half comprising disease cases; for each DR severity class, 100 and 50 cases were used. Fine-tuned models were tested internally using the SEED (53,090 images) and APTOS-2019 (3,672 images) datasets and externally validated on population-based (BES, CIEMS, SP2, UKBB) and open-source datasets (ODIR-5k, PAPILA, GAMMA, IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2). Model performance was compared using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Z-tests with Bonferroni correction (P<0.05/3). Interpretation: Traditional DL models are mostly comparable to RETFound for ocular disease detection with large datasets. However, RETFound is superior in systemic disease detection with smaller datasets. These findings offer valuable insights into the respective merits and limitation of traditional models and FMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedicoSAM: Towards foundation models for medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11734v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is an important analysis task in clinical practice and research. Deep learning has massively advanced the field, but current approaches are mostly based on models trained for a specific task. Training such models or adapting them to a new condition is costly due to the need for (manually) labeled data. The emergence of vision foundation models, especially Segment Anything, offers a path to universal segmentation for medical images, overcoming these issues. Here, we study how to improve Segment Anything for medical images by comparing different finetuning strategies on a large and diverse dataset. We evaluate the finetuned models on a wide range of interactive and (automatic) semantic segmentation tasks. We find that the performance can be clearly improved for interactive segmentation. However, semantic segmentation does not benefit from pretraining on medical images. Our best model, MedicoSAM, is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/medico-sam. We show that it is compatible with existing tools for data annotation and believe that it will be of great practical value.</p></details> |  |

However, graph learning has predominantly focused on single-graph models, tailored to specific tasks or datasets, lacking the ability to transfer learned knowledge to different domains. This limitation stems from the inherent complexity and diversity of graph structures, along with the different feature and label spaces specific to graph data. In this paper, we recognize text as an effective unifying medium and employ Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) to leverage this potential. We present our UniGraph framework, designed to learn a foundation model for TAGs, which is capable of generalizing to unseen graphs and tasks across diverse domains. Unlike single-graph models that use pre-computed node features of varying dimensions as input, our approach leverages textual features for unifying node representations, even for graphs such as molecular graphs that do not naturally have textual features. We propose a novel cascaded architecture of Language Models (LMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as backbone networks. Additionally, we propose the first pre-training algorithm specifically designed for large-scale self-supervised learning on TAGs, based on Masked Graph Modeling. We introduce graph instruction tuning using Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable zero-shot prediction ability. Our comprehensive experiments across various graph learning tasks and domains demonstrate the model's effectiveness in self-supervised representation learning on unseen graphs, few-shot in-context transfer, and zero-shot transfer, even surpassing or matching the performance of GNNs that have undergone supervised training on target datasets.</p></details> | KDD 2025 |

In response, disaster benchmark datasets from high-resolution satellite imagery have been constructed to develop methods for detecting damaged areas. However, these methods face significant challenges when applied to previously unseen regions due to the limited geographical and disaster-type diversity in the existing datasets. We introduce DAVI (Disaster Assessment with VIsion foundation model), a novel approach that addresses domain disparities and detects structural damage at the building level without requiring ground-truth labels for target regions. DAVI combines task-specific knowledge from a model trained on source regions with task-agnostic knowledge from an image segmentation model to generate pseudo labels indicating potential damage in target regions. It then utilizes a two-stage refinement process, which operate at both pixel and image levels, to accurately identify changes in disaster-affected areas. Our evaluation, including a case study on the 2023 T\"urkiye earthquake, demonstrates that our model achieves exceptional performance across diverse terrains (e.g., North America, Asia, and the Middle East) and disaster types (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and tsunamis).

The lack of large-scale, comprehensive datasets and sophisticated monitoring systems has created a widening gap between industry advancement and public health oversight. This paper addresses this critical challenge by introducing Tobacco-1M, a comprehensive dataset of one million tobacco product images with hierarchical labels spanning 75 product categories, and DEFEND, a novel foundation model for tobacco product understanding. Our approach integrates a Feature Enhancement Module for rich multimodal representation learning, a Local-Global Visual Coherence mechanism for detailed feature discrimination, and an Enhanced Image-Text Alignment strategy for precise product characterization. Experimental results demonstrate DEFEND's superior performance, achieving 83.1% accuracy in product classification and 73.8% in visual question-answering tasks, outperforming existing methods by significant margins. Moreover, the model exhibits robust zero-shot learning capabilities with 45.6% accuracy on novel product categories. This work provides regulatory bodies and public health researchers with powerful tools for monitoring emerging tobacco products and marketing strategies, potentially revolutionizing approaches to tobacco control and public health surveillance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Here, we present a systematic evaluation of transfer learning strategies for brain tumor classification using these models. We analyzed 252 cases comprising five major tumor types: glioblastoma, astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, primary central nervous system lymphoma, and metastatic tumors. Comparing state-of-the-art foundation models with conventional approaches, we found that foundation models demonstrated robust classification performance with as few as 10 patches per case, challenging the traditional assumption that extensive per-case image sampling is necessary. Furthermore, our evaluation revealed that simple transfer learning strategies like linear probing were sufficient, while fine-tuning often degraded model performance. These findings suggest a paradigm shift from extensive data collection to efficient utilization of pretrained features, providing practical implications for implementing AI-assisted diagnosis in clinical pathology.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

These models are meant as foundation models with deep knowledge about e-commerce, that form a base for instruction- and fine-tuning. The e-Llama models are obtained by continuously pretraining the Llama 3.1 base models on 1 trillion tokens of domain-specific data. We discuss our approach and motivate our choice of hyperparameters with a series of ablation studies. To quantify how well the models have been adapted to the e-commerce domain, we define and implement a set of multilingual, e-commerce specific evaluation tasks. We show that, when carefully choosing the training setup, the Llama 3.1 models can be adapted towards the new domain without sacrificing significant performance on general domain tasks. We also explore the possibility of merging the adapted model and the base model for a better control of the performance trade-off between domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>inclu...</summary><p>include full author name</p></details> |

Current road obstacle detection methods typically assign a score to each pixel and apply a threshold to generate final predictions. However, selecting an appropriate threshold is challenging, and the per-pixel classification approach often leads to fragmented predictions with numerous false positives. In this work, we propose a novel method that leverages segment-level features from visual foundation models and likelihood ratios to predict road obstacles directly. By focusing on segments rather than individual pixels, our approach enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and offers increased robustness to scene variability. We benchmark our approach against existing methods on the RoadObstacle and LostAndFound datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance without needing a predefined threshold.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, and 1 table, to be published in VISAPP 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Fixing Function-Level Code Generation Errors for Foundation Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00676v2)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-level code generation leverages foundation Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically produce source code with expected functionality. It has been widely investigated and applied in intelligent programming assistants, such as GitHub Copilot, to enhance software development productivity. Despite advancements in foundation LLMs, the generation involves many errors. Existing studies leverage static analysis tools (e.g., TBar) or add another fixing LLM (i.e., LDB) to post-process these errors. However, there are still many errors remaining to be solved because their root causes have not been investigated yet, making it challenging to design better fixing tools. In this paper, we first conducted an empirical study on the generation errors. Specifically, we reproduced 14 representative LLMs on the HumanEval dataset and verified their correctness. We obtained 12,837 code generation errors and conducted an analysis of their causes, leading to 19 categories of error causes. Our empirical analysis indicated that three of these causes can be directly fixed. Based on the findings, we proposed a fixing method called LlmFix, which addresses these three types of errors through a three-step process: filtering code for indentation correction, truncating redundant generated code, and importing missing modules. Evaluations of LlmFix are conducted from two perspectives: its performance on error-fixing tasks and its impact on improving function-level code generation tasks. For error fixing performance, we built an evaluation dataset LlmErrorEval. Experimental results show that LlmFix achieves a fix rate of 17.1% outperforming the best LDB by 8.9%. For code generation improvements, evaluations of LlmFix on both the HumanEval and MBPP datasets demonstrate its effectiveness, improving code generation accuracy by an average of 7.5% across 14 LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling the Mystery of Weight in Large Foundation Models: Gaussian Distribution Never Fades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10661v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a pioneering exploration of the mechanisms underlying large foundation models' (LFMs) weights, aiming to simplify AI research. Through extensive observation and analysis on prevailing LFMs, we find that regardless of initialization strategies, their weights predominantly follow a Gaussian distribution, with occasional sharp, inverted T-shaped, or linear patterns. We further discover that the weights share the i.i.d. properties of Gaussian noise, and explore their direct relationship. We find that transformation weights can be derived from Gaussian noise, and they primarily serve to increase the standard deviation of pre-trained weights, with their standard deviation growing with layer depth. In other words, transformation weights broaden the acceptable deviation from the optimal weights, facilitating adaptation to downstream tasks. Building upon the above conclusions, we thoroughly discussed the nature of optimal weights, ultimately concluding that they should exhibit zero-mean, symmetry, and sparsity, with the sparse values being a truncated Gaussian distribution and a few outliers. Our experiments in LFM adaptation and editing demonstrate the effectiveness of these insights. We hope these findings can provide a foundational understanding to pave the way for future advancements in the LFM community.</p></details> | Revisions ongoing |
| **[Exploring Prediction Targets in Masked Pre-Training for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10788v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models, such as HuBERT and its variants, are pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled speech data and then used for a range of downstream tasks. These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework impacts their performance on downstream tasks. For instance, models pre-trained with targets that capture prosody learn representations suited for speaker-related tasks, while those pre-trained with targets that capture phonetics learn representations suited for content-related tasks. Moreover, prediction targets can differ in the level of detail they capture. Models pre-trained with targets that encode fine-grained acoustic features perform better on tasks like denoising, while those pre-trained with targets focused on higher-level abstractions are more effective for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | ICASSP 2025 |
| **[Universal Actions for Enhanced Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10105v1)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training on diverse, internet-scale data is a key factor in the success of recent large foundation models. Yet, using the same recipe for building embodied agents has faced noticeable difficulties. Despite the availability of many crowd-sourced embodied datasets, their action spaces often exhibit significant heterogeneity due to distinct physical embodiment and control interfaces for different robots, causing substantial challenges in developing embodied foundation models using cross-domain data. In this paper, we introduce UniAct, a new embodied foundation modeling framework operating in a tokenized Universal Action Space. Our learned universal actions capture the generic atomic behaviors across diverse robots by exploiting their shared structural features, and enable enhanced cross-domain data utilization and cross-embodiment generalizations by eliminating the notorious heterogeneity. The universal actions can be efficiently translated back to heterogeneous actionable commands by simply adding embodiment-specific details, from which fast adaptation to new robots becomes simple and straightforward. Our 0.5B instantiation of UniAct outperforms 14X larger SOTA embodied foundation models in extensive evaluations on various real-world and simulation robots, showcasing exceptional cross-embodiment control and adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of adopting universal actions.

Our method integrates the foundation models CLIPSeg and Segment Anything Model (SAM) with the interest point detector SuperPoint and a graph convolutional network (GCN) to accurately segment machinery parts. By providing 1 to 25 annotated samples, our model, evaluated on a purely synthetic dataset depicting a truck-mounted loading crane, achieves effective segmentation across various levels of detail. Training times are kept under five minutes on consumer GPUs. The model demonstrates robust generalization to real data, achieving a qualitative synthetic-to-real generalization with a $J\&F$ score of 92.2 on real data using 10 synthetic support samples. When benchmarked on the DAVIS 2017 dataset, it achieves a $J\&F$ score of 71.5 in semi-supervised video segmentation with three support samples. This method's fast training times and effective generalization to real data make it a valuable tool for autonomous systems interacting with machinery and infrastructure, and illustrate the potential of combined and orchestrated foundation models for few-shot segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV) 2025.

These models serve as a versatile base for a wide range of downstream tasks, including those in medicine and healthcare. FMs have demonstrated remarkable success across multiple healthcare domains. However, existing surveys in this field do not comprehensively cover all areas where FMs have made significant strides. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of FMs in medicine, focusing on their evolution, learning strategies, flagship models, applications, and associated challenges. We examine how prominent FMs, such as the BERT and GPT families, are transforming various aspects of healthcare, including clinical large language models, medical image analysis, and omics research. Additionally, we provide a detailed taxonomy of FM-enabled healthcare applications, spanning clinical natural language processing, medical computer vision, graph learning, and other biology- and omics- related tasks. Despite the transformative potentials of FMs, they also pose unique challenges. This survey delves into these challenges and highlights open research questions and lessons learned to guide researchers and practitioners. Our goal is to provide valuable insights into the capabilities of FMs in health, facilitating responsible deployment and mitigating associated risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review in IEEE REVIEWS IN BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING</p></details> |

Real-world challenges like occlusion and non-texture hinder accurate disparity estimation from binocular matching cues. Recently, monocular relative depth estimation has shown remarkable generalization using vision foundation models. Thus, to facilitate robust stereo matching with monocular depth cues, we incorporate a robust monocular relative depth model into the recurrent stereo-matching framework, building a new framework for depth foundation model-based stereo-matching, DEFOM-Stereo. In the feature extraction stage, we construct the combined context and matching feature encoder by integrating features from conventional CNNs and DEFOM. In the update stage, we use the depth predicted by DEFOM to initialize the recurrent disparity and introduce a scale update module to refine the disparity at the correct scale. DEFOM-Stereo is verified to have comparable performance on the Scene Flow dataset with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and notably shows much stronger zero-shot generalization. Moreover, DEFOM-Stereo achieves SOTA performance on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, Middlebury, and ETH3D benchmarks, ranking 1st on many metrics. In the joint evaluation under the robust vision challenge, our model simultaneously outperforms previous models on the individual benchmarks. Both results demonstrate the outstanding capabilities of the proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DEFOM-Stereo</p></details> |

However, their application in surgical computer vision has been limited. This study addresses this gap by introducing SurgeNetXL, a novel surgical foundation model that sets a new benchmark in surgical computer vision. Trained on the largest reported surgical dataset to date, comprising over 4.7 million video frames, SurgeNetXL achieves consistent top-tier performance across six datasets spanning four surgical procedures and three tasks, including semantic segmentation, phase recognition, and critical view of safety (CVS) classification. Compared with the best-performing surgical foundation models, SurgeNetXL shows mean improvements of 2.4, 9.0, and 12.6 percent for semantic segmentation, phase recognition, and CVS classification, respectively. Additionally, SurgeNetXL outperforms the best-performing ImageNet-based variants by 14.4, 4.0, and 1.6 percent in the respective tasks. In addition to advancing model performance, this study provides key insights into scaling pretraining datasets, extending training durations, and optimizing model architectures specifically for surgical computer vision. These findings pave the way for improved generalizability and robustness in data-scarce scenarios, offering a comprehensive framework for future research in this domain. All models and a subset of the SurgeNetXL dataset, including over 2 million video frames, are publicly available at: https://github.com/TimJaspers0801/SurgeNet.</p></details> |  |

| **[Few-Shot Adaptation of Training-Free Foundation Model for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09138v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models have achieved remarkable progress across various image analysis tasks. In the image segmentation task, foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) enable generalizable zero-shot segmentation through user-provided prompts. However, SAM primarily trained on natural images, lacks the domain-specific expertise of medical imaging. This limitation poses challenges when applying SAM to medical image segmentation, including the need for extensive fine-tuning on specialized medical datasets and a dependency on manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. This work introduces the Few-shot Adaptation of Training-frEe SAM (FATE-SAM), a novel method designed to adapt the advanced Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D medical image segmentation. FATE-SAM reassembles pre-trained modules of SAM2 to enable few-shot adaptation, leveraging a small number of support examples to capture anatomical knowledge and perform prompt-free segmentation, without requiring model fine-tuning. To handle the volumetric nature of medical images, we incorporate a Volumetric Consistency mechanism that enhances spatial coherence across 3D slices. We evaluate FATE-SAM on multiple medical imaging datasets and compare it with supervised learning methods, zero-shot SAM approaches, and fine-tuned medical SAM methods. Results show that FATE-SAM delivers robust and accurate segmentation while eliminating the need for large annotated datasets and expert intervention. FATE-SAM provides a practical, efficient solution for medical image segmentation, making it more accessible for clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Traditional object detection algorithms are inherently closed-set, limiting their capability to handle NOD. We present a novel approach to transform existing closed-set detectors into open-set detectors. This transformation is achieved by leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained foundational models, specifically CLIP and SAM, through our cooperative mechanism. Furthermore, by integrating this mechanism with state-of-the-art open-set detectors such as GDINO, we establish new benchmarks in object detection performance. Our method achieves 17.42 mAP in novel object detection and 42.08 mAP for known objects on the challenging LVIS dataset.

| **[Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09009v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Here, we developed CT-FM, a large-scale 3D image-based pre-trained model designed explicitly for various radiological tasks.

Beyond quantitative success, CT-FM demonstrated the ability to cluster regions anatomically and identify similar anatomical and structural concepts across scans. Furthermore, it remained robust across test-retest settings and indicated reasonable salient regions attached to its embeddings. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale medical imaging foundation models and by open-sourcing the model weights, code, and data, aims to support more adaptable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, followed by 9 Extended Data Figures and a Supplementary Information document</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundation Models: Evaluation of Geoscience Artificial Intelligence with Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14809v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the geoscience community with deep learning models (DLMs) that are trained to complete specific tasks within workflows. This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Language-Image Model of the Retina (FLAIR): Encoding Expert Knowledge in Text Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07898v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation vision-language models are currently transforming computer vision, and are on the rise in medical imaging fueled by their very promising generalization capabilities. However, the initial attempts to transfer this new paradigm to medical imaging have shown less impressive performances than those observed in other domains, due to the significant domain shift and the complex, expert domain knowledge inherent to medical-imaging tasks. Motivated by the need for domain-expert foundation models, we present FLAIR, a pre-trained vision-language model for universal retinal fundus image understanding. To this end, we compiled 38 open-access, mostly categorical fundus imaging datasets from various sources, with up to 101 different target conditions and 288,307 images. We integrate the expert's domain knowledge in the form of descriptive textual prompts, during both pre-training and zero-shot inference, enhancing the less-informative categorical supervision of the data. Such a textual expert's knowledge, which we compiled from the relevant clinical literature and community standards, describes the fine-grained features of the pathologies as well as the hierarchies and dependencies between them. We report comprehensive evaluations, which illustrate the benefit of integrating expert knowledge and the strong generalization capabilities of FLAIR under difficult scenarios with domain shifts or unseen categories. When adapted with a lightweight linear probe, FLAIR outperforms fully-trained, dataset-focused models, more so in the few-shot regimes. Interestingly, FLAIR outperforms by a wide margin larger-scale generalist image-language models and retina domain-specific self-supervised networks, which emphasizes the potential of embedding experts' domain knowledge and the limitations of generalist models in medical imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Medical Image Analysis.

In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |

These biases, rooted in the overrepresentation of stereotypes and societal inequalities in training data, exacerbate real-world discrimination, reinforce harmful stereotypes, and erode trust in AI systems. To address this, we introduce Trident Probe Testing (TriProTesting), a systematic testing method that detects explicit and implicit biases using semantically designed probes. Here we show that FMs, including CLIP, ALIGN, BridgeTower, and OWLv2, demonstrate pervasive biases across single and mixed social attributes (gender, race, age, and occupation). Notably, we uncover mixed biases when social attributes are combined, such as gender x race, gender x age, and gender x occupation, revealing deeper layers of discrimination. We further propose Adaptive Logit Adjustment (AdaLogAdjustment), a post-processing technique that dynamically redistributes probability power to mitigate these biases effectively, achieving significant improvements in fairness without retraining models. These findings highlight the urgent need for ethical AI practices and interdisciplinary solutions to address biases not only at the model level but also in societal structures. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution that advances fairness in AI systems while offering practical insights for future research on fair AI technologies.</p></details> | 60 pages, 5 figures |

Metric depth estimation, which involves predicting absolute distances, poses particular challenges, as even the most advanced foundation models remain prone to critical errors. Since quantifying the uncertainty has emerged as a promising endeavor to address these limitations and enable trustworthy deployment, we fuse five different uncertainty quantification methods with the current state-of-the-art DepthAnythingV2 foundation model. To cover a wide range of metric depth domains, we evaluate their performance on four diverse datasets. Our findings identify fine-tuning with the Gaussian Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (GNLL) as a particularly promising approach, offering reliable uncertainty estimates while maintaining predictive performance and computational efficiency on par with the baseline, encompassing both training and inference time. By fusing uncertainty quantification and foundation models within the context of monocular depth estimation, this paper lays a critical foundation for future research aimed at improving not only model performance but also its explainability. Extending this critical synthesis of uncertainty quantification and foundation models into other crucial tasks, such as semantic segmentation and pose estimation, presents exciting opportunities for safer and more reliable machine vision systems.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of large foundation models such as DINOv2 and Metric3Dv2, a pertinent question arises: can these models be integrated into existing model architectures to not only reduce the required training data but surpass the performance of current models? We choose two model architectures in the vehicle segmentation domain to alter: Lift-Splat-Shoot, and Simple-BEV. For Lift-Splat-Shoot, we explore the implementation of frozen DINOv2 for feature extraction and Metric3Dv2 for depth estimation, where we greatly exceed the baseline results by 7.4 IoU while utilizing only half the training data and iterations. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative application of Metric3Dv2's depth information as a PseudoLiDAR point cloud incorporated into the Simple-BEV architecture, replacing traditional LiDAR. This integration results in a +3 IoU improvement compared to the Camera-only model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Electronic Imaging - Autonomous Vehicles and Machines Connference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spurious Feature Eraser: Stabilizing Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00376v3)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models have exhibited remarkable success across a multitude of downstream tasks due to their scalability on extensive image-text paired data. However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and intra-class variations without using real data in model training. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated by the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations, combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline.

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

However, similar advancements in health data modeling remain limited due to the need for innovative adaptations. Wearable movement data offers a valuable avenue for exploration, as it's a core feature in nearly all commercial smartwatches, well established in clinical and mental health research, and the sequential nature of the data shares similarities to language. We introduce the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT), the first open source foundation model designed for time-series wearable movement data. Leveraging transformer-based architectures and novel techniques, such as patch embeddings, and pretraining on data from 29,307 participants in a national U.S. sample, PAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in several mental health prediction tasks. PAT is also lightweight and easily interpretable, making it a robust tool for mental health research. GitHub: https://github.com/njacobsonlab/Pretrained-Actigraphy-Transformer/</p></details> |  |

While open models usually operate at a smaller scale, they maintain competitiveness through specialization and fine-tuning. However, a significant challenge persists: open models often underperform in low-resource languages due to limited representation in the training corpus. In this paper, we present LLMic, a bilingual foundation language model designed specifically for the Romanian Language. We document the complete process of pretraining a foundation model for a low-resource language, including corpus construction, architecture selection, and hyper-parameter optimization. Our evaluation demonstrates that LLMic can be specialized for tasks in the target language, achieving results comparable to other much larger open models. We show that fine-tuning LLMic for language translation after the initial pretraining phase outperforms existing solutions in English-to-Romanian translation tasks. This opens the path for efficient large-scale processing for the Romanian language community, using the much smaller LLMic model</p></details> |  |

Automating this fine-tuning process is challenging, as it typically needs human feedback that can be expensive to acquire. We present AutoRefine, a method that leverages reinforcement learning for targeted fine-tuning, utilizing direct feedback from measurable performance improvements in specific downstream tasks. We demonstrate the method for a problem arising in algorithmic hiring platforms where linguistic biases influence a recommendation system. In this setting, a generative model seeks to rewrite given job specifications to receive more diverse candidate matches from a recommendation engine which matches jobs to candidates. Our model detects and regulates biases in job descriptions to meet diversity and fairness criteria. The experiments on a public hiring dataset and a real-world hiring platform showcase how large language models can assist in identifying and mitigation biases in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025, AI Governance Workshop</p></details> |

Gaps in smart meter data can bias consumption analyses and hinder reliable predictions, causing technical and economic inefficiencies. As smart meter data grows in volume and complexity, conventional techniques struggle with its nonlinear and nonstationary patterns. In this context, Generative Artificial Intelligence offers promising solutions that may outperform traditional statistical methods. In this paper, we evaluate two general-purpose Large Language Models and five Time Series Foundation Models for smart meter data imputation, comparing them with conventional Machine Learning and statistical models. We introduce artificial gaps (30 minutes to one day) into an anonymized public dataset to test inference capabilities. Results show that Time Series Foundation Models, with their contextual understanding and pattern recognition, could significantly enhance imputation accuracy in certain cases. However, the trade-off between computational cost and performance gains remains a critical consideration.</p></details> |  |

This poses a serious privacy threat as motion extraction from video and motion capture are increasingly used for a variety of applications, including mixed reality, robotics, medicine, and the quantified self. In order to protect the privacy of the tracked individuals, anonymization techniques that preserve the utility of the data are required. However, anonymizing motion data is a challenging task because there are many dependencies in motion sequences (such as physiological constraints) that, if ignored, make the anonymized motion sequence appear unnatural. In this paper, we propose Pantomime, a full-body anonymization technique for motion data, which uses foundation motion models to generate motion sequences that adhere to the dependencies in the data, thus keeping the utility of the anonymized data high. Our results show that Pantomime can maintain the naturalness of the motion sequences while reducing the identification accuracy to 10%.</p></details> |  |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[Explore the Use of Time Series Foundation Model for Car-Following Behavior Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07034v1)** | 2025-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling car-following behavior is essential for traffic simulation, analyzing driving patterns, and understanding complex traffic flows with varying levels of autonomous vehicles. Traditional models like the Safe Distance Model and Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) require precise parameter calibration and often lack generality due to simplified assumptions about driver behavior. While machine learning and deep learning methods capture complex patterns, they require large labeled datasets. Foundation models provide a more efficient alternative. Pre-trained on vast, diverse time series datasets, they can be applied directly to various tasks without the need for extensive re-training. These models generalize well across domains, and with minimal fine-tuning, they can be adapted to specific tasks like car-following behavior prediction. In this paper, we apply Chronos, a state-of-the-art public time series foundation model, to analyze car-following behavior using the Open ACC dataset. Without fine-tuning, Chronos outperforms traditional models like IDM and Exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality (ETS), and achieves similar results to deep learning models such as DeepAR and TFT, with an RMSE of 0.60. After fine-tuning, Chronos reduces the error to an RMSE of 0.53, representing a 33.75% improvement over IDM and a 12-37% reduction compared to machine learning models like ETS and deep learning models including DeepAR, WaveNet, and TFT. This demonstrates the potential of foundation models to significantly advance transportation research, offering a scalable, adaptable, and highly accurate approach to predicting and simulating car-following behaviors.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as powerful tools in meteorology, capable of analyzing complex weather and climate data by learning intricate dependencies and providing rapid predictions once trained. While these models demonstrate promising performance in weather prediction, often surpassing traditional physics-based methods, they still face critical challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent deep learning and foundation models for weather prediction. We propose a taxonomy to classify existing models based on their training paradigms: deterministic predictive learning, probabilistic generative learning, and pre-training and fine-tuning. For each paradigm, we delve into the underlying model architectures, address major challenges, offer key insights, and propose targeted directions for future research. Furthermore, we explore real-world applications of these methods and provide a curated summary of open-source code repositories and widely used datasets, aiming to bridge research advancements with practical implementations while fostering open and trustworthy scientific practices in adopting cutting-edge artificial intelligence for weather prediction.

However, their potential development to breast ultrasound analysis remains untapped. In this paper, we present BUSGen, the first foundational generative model specifically designed for breast ultrasound image analysis. Pretrained on over 3.5 million breast ultrasound images, BUSGen has acquired extensive knowledge of breast structures, pathological features, and clinical variations. With few-shot adaptation, BUSGen can generate repositories of realistic and informative task-specific data, facilitating the development of models for a wide range of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments highlight BUSGen's exceptional adaptability, significantly exceeding real-data-trained foundational models in breast cancer screening, diagnosis, and prognosis. In breast cancer early diagnosis, our approach outperformed all board-certified radiologists (n=9), achieving an average sensitivity improvement of 16.5% (P-value<0.0001). Additionally, we characterized the scaling effect of using generated data which was as effective as the collected real-world data for training diagnostic models. Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrated that our approach improved the generalization ability of downstream models. Importantly, BUSGen protected patient privacy by enabling fully de-identified data sharing, making progress forward in secure medical data utilization.

The INFORMATE Project has combined three data sources to focus on understanding how the global research infrastructure might help the US National Science Foundation (NSF) and other federal agencies identify and characterize the impact of their support. In this paper we present INFORMATE observations of three data systems. The NSF Award database represents NSF funding while the NSF Public Access Repository (PAR) and CHORUS, as a proxy for the GRI, represent two different view of results of that funding. We compare the first at the level of awards and the second two at the level of published research articles. Our findings demonstrate that CHORUS datasets include significantly more NSF awards and more related papers than does PAR. Our findings also suggest that time plays a significant role in the inclusion of award metadata across the sources analyzed. Data in those sources travel very different journeys, each presenting different obstacles to metadata completeness and suggesting necessary actions on the parts of authors and publishers to ensure that publication and funding metadata are captured. We discuss these actions, as well as implications our findings have for emergent technologies such as artificial intelligence and natural language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 tables, 15 figures</p></details> |

Current research primarily utilizes pre-trained language models to encode textual descriptions and align them with visual modalities, thereby facilitating the expression of relevant visual features. However, these approaches often struggle to establish robust alignments between fine-grained semantic concepts, leading to inconsistent representations across textual and visual information. To address these limitations, we introduce a referring remote sensing image segmentation foundational model, RSRefSeg. RSRefSeg leverages CLIP for visual and textual encoding, employing both global and local textual semantics as filters to generate referring-related visual activation features in the latent space. These activated features then serve as input prompts for SAM, which refines the segmentation masks through its robust visual generalization capabilities. Experimental results on the RRSIS-D dataset demonstrate that RSRefSeg outperforms existing methods, underscoring the effectiveness of foundational models in enhancing multimodal task comprehension.

Often, these intermediate features require further fine-tuning or processing with additional neural network layers to align the final similarity scores with human judgments. So far, most IQA models based on foundation models have primarily relied on the final layer or the embedding for the quality score estimation. In contrast, this work explores the potential of utilizing the intermediate features of these foundation models, which have largely been unexplored so far in the design of low-level perceptual similarity metrics. We demonstrate that the intermediate features are comparatively more effective. Moreover, without requiring any training, these metrics can outperform both traditional and state-of-the-art learned metrics by utilizing distance measures between the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025, Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/ZS-IQA</p></details> |

These generalization capabilities are attractive in areas such as NIR Iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD), in which databases are limited in the number of subjects and diversity of attack instruments, and there is no correspondence between the bona fide and attack images because, most of the time, they do not belong to the same subjects. This work explores an iris PAD approach based on two foundation models, DinoV2 and VisualOpenClip. The results show that fine-tuning prediction with a small neural network as head overpasses the state-of-the-art performance based on deep learning approaches. However, systems trained from scratch have still reached better results if bona fide and attack images are available.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually employ neural radiance fields to produce voxelized 3D occupancy, lacking instance-level semantic reasoning and temporal photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

These models, based on foundation models such as Large Language Models (LLMs) - trained on broad data - are tailored to address the demands of physics research. LPMs can function independently or as part of an integrated framework. This framework can incorporate specialized tools, including symbolic reasoning modules for mathematical manipulations, frameworks to analyse specific experimental and simulated data, and mechanisms for synthesizing theories and scientific literature. We begin by examining whether the physics community should actively develop and refine dedicated models, rather than relying solely on commercial LLMs. We then outline how LPMs can be realized through interdisciplinary collaboration among experts in physics, computer science, and philosophy of science. To integrate these models effectively, we identify three key pillars: Development, Evaluation, and Philosophical Reflection. Development focuses on constructing models capable of processing physics texts, mathematical formulations, and diverse physical data. Evaluation assesses accuracy and reliability by testing and benchmarking. Finally, Philosophical Reflection encompasses the analysis of broader implications of LLMs in physics, including their potential to generate new scientific understanding and what novel collaboration dynamics might arise in research. Inspired by the organizational structure of experimental collaborations in particle physics, we propose a similarly interdisciplinary and collaborative approach to building and refining Large Physics Models. This roadmap provides specific objectives, defines pathways to achieve them, and identifies challenges that must be addressed to realise physics-specific large scale AI models.</p></details> |  |

A key task in this field is the identification and segmentation of cells in hematoxylin and eosin-stained images. Existing methods for cell segmentation often require extensive annotated datasets for training and are limited to a predefined cell classification scheme. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$, a framework for generalized cell segmentation in digital pathology. $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ utilizes Vision Transformers with foundation models as encoders to compute deep cell features and segmentation masks simultaneously. To adapt to unseen cell types, we rely on a computationally efficient approach. It requires minimal data for training and leads to a drastically reduced carbon footprint. We demonstrate excellent performance on seven different datasets, covering a broad spectrum of cell types, organs, and clinical settings. The framework achieves remarkable zero-shot segmentation and data-efficient cell-type classification. Furthermore, we show that $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ can leverage immunofluorescence stainings to generate training datasets without the need for pathologist annotations. The automated dataset generation approach surpasses the performance of networks trained on manually labeled data, demonstrating its effectiveness in creating high-quality training datasets without expert annotations. To advance digital pathology, $\text{CellViT}^{{\scriptscriptstyle ++}}$ is available as an open-source framework featuring a user-friendly, web-based interface for visualization and annotation.

State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods.

However, its adaptation in medical settings still faces significant challenges, related to data availability and privacy constraints. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues, addressing data scarcity while preserving privacy. Recently, Latent Diffusion Models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality synthetic data.

Existing approaches struggle to integrate complementary information and lack the ability to generate modalities simultaneously. To address this challenge, we present MedCoDi-M, a 6.77-billion-parameter model, designed for multimodal medical data generation, that, following Foundation Model paradigm, exploits contrastive learning and large quantity of data to build a shared latent space which capture the relationships between different data modalities. Further, we introduce the Multi-Prompt training technique, which significantly boosts MedCoDi-M's generation under different settings. We extensively validate MedCoDi-M: first we benchmark it against five competitors on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, a state-of-the-art dataset for Chest X-ray and radiological report generation. Secondly, we perform a Visual Turing Test with expert radiologists to assess the realism and clinical relevance of the generated data, ensuring alignment with real-world scenarios. Finally, we assess the utility of MedCoDi-M in addressing key challenges in the medical field, such as anonymization, data scarcity and imbalance learning. The results are promising, demonstrating the applicability of MedCoDi-M in medical contexts. Project page is at https://cosbidev.github.io/MedCoDi-M/.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Tabular Foundation Model TabPFN Outperforms Specialized Time Series Forecasting Models Based on Simple Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02945v2)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become popular in forecasting due to their ability to make accurate predictions, even with minimal fine-tuning on specific datasets. In this paper, we demonstrate how the newly released regression variant of TabPFN, a general tabular foundation model, can be applied to time series forecasting. We propose a straightforward approach, TabPFN-TS, which pairs TabPFN with simple feature engineering to achieve strong forecasting performance. Despite its simplicity and with only 11M parameters, TabPFN-TS outperforms Chronos-Mini, a model of similar size, and matches or even slightly outperforms Chronos-Large, which has 65-fold more parameters. A key strength of our method lies in its reliance solely on artificial data during pre-training, avoiding the need for large training datasets and eliminating the risk of benchmark contamination.</p></details> |  |

A Holistic Embodied Cognition Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05031v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Rh-Dang/ECBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiomedCLIP: a multimodal biomedical foundation model pretrained from fifteen million scientific image-text pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00915v3)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical data is inherently multimodal, comprising physical measurements and natural language narratives. A generalist biomedical AI model needs to simultaneously process different modalities of data, including text and images. Therefore, training an effective generalist biomedical model requires high-quality multimodal data, such as parallel image-text pairs. Here, we present PMC-15M, a novel dataset that is two orders of magnitude larger than existing biomedical multimodal datasets such as MIMIC-CXR, and spans a diverse range of biomedical image types. PMC-15M contains 15 million biomedical image-text pairs collected from 4.4 million scientific articles. Based on PMC-15M, we have pretrained BiomedCLIP, a multimodal foundation model, with domain-specific adaptations tailored to biomedical vision-language processing. We conducted extensive experiments and ablation studies on standard biomedical imaging tasks from retrieval to classification to visual question-answering (VQA). BiomedCLIP achieved new state-of-the-art results in a wide range of standard datasets, substantially outperforming prior approaches. Intriguingly, by large-scale pretraining on diverse biomedical image types, BiomedCLIP even outperforms state-of-the-art radiology-specific models such as BioViL in radiology-specific tasks such as RSNA pneumonia detection. In summary, BiomedCLIP is a fully open-access foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on various biomedical tasks, paving the way for transformative multimodal biomedical discovery and applications. We release our models at https://aka.ms/biomedclip to facilitate future research in multimodal biomedical AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The models are released at https://aka.ms/biomedclip</p></details> |

We present the first named entity recognition (NER) dataset, HisTR and the first Universal Dependencies treebank, OTA-BOUN for a historical form of the Turkish language along with transformer-based models trained using these datasets for named entity recognition, dependency parsing, and part-of-speech tagging tasks. Additionally, we introduce Ottoman Text Corpus (OTC), a clean corpus of transliterated historical Turkish texts that spans a wide range of historical periods. Our experimental results show significant improvements in the computational analysis of historical Turkish, achieving promising results in tasks that require understanding of historical linguistic structures. They also highlight existing challenges, such as domain adaptation and language variations across time periods. All of the presented resources and models are made available at https://huggingface.co/bucolin to serve as a benchmark for future progress in historical Turkish NLP.</p></details> |  |
